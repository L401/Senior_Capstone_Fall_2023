The TOMA or their designees will access TODPG to accomplish the following:  5.1.3.1 The ﬁrst action must be to establish a TODPG User Proﬁle (See FUG https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).  5.1.3.2 Initial TODPG training for users will be accomplished by contacting the local TO Site Functional Office TODPG POC. Also, TODPG Functional User Guides are located on the Air Force Technical Order Managers SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.  5.1.4 Requirements for TODPG Operations.  5.1.4.1 Loading ID Increments. The TOMA or designee will prepare the digital TO ID print and merged packages. TOMA will submit by accessing TODPG and completing the ordering processes for job(s) created when Available for Index was set to Yes in ETIMS. For detailed instructions, refer to the FUG on the Air Force Technical Order Managers SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.

For step by step procedures for uploading PDF ﬁles, access the TODPG Functional User Guides located on the Air Force Technical Order Management SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.  5.1.4.1.2 A Reproduction Assembly, AFTO Form 30, Reproduction Assembly Sheet, is not required but can be uploaded into TODPG when the TOMA has determined it necessary to specify printing instructions. Special printing requirements (i.e. foldouts, color pages, bleed border, etc.), will be shipped at the end of the TO and may require collating during TO posting.  5.1.4.1.3 Indiscriminate marking of jobs as emergency/urgent causes delays in true emergency/urgent processing as well as routine processing. Use of Emergency and Urgent submission of ID jobs will be limited to following cases:  • Emergency print requests support TO requirements that WOULD result in a fatality or serious injury to personnel,  extensive damage or destruction of equipment or property and must be processed within 48 to 72 hours.  • Urgent print requests support TO requirements that COULD cause one or more of the following: personnel injury, damage to equipment or property, reduce operation efficiency and/or jeopardize the safety or success of mission accomplishment. Urgent must be published and distributed within 40 calendar days.  NOTE  Both the ID and merged jobs have to be at content loaded status in TODPG before ETIMS will set the Available for Distribution ﬂags to yes and generate ID labels.  5.1.4.2 Mandatory Uploads of Complete Merged TOs & TCTOs. Once a single TO/TCTO has been made available for index in ETIMS or an interim supplement has been distributed digitally, a merged copy of the TO must be uploaded to TODPG.  5-2 ', 'TO 00-5-3  Technical Data:1. (FAR deﬁnition) Technical data is deﬁned in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) as: Recorded information (regardless of the form or method of recording) of a scientiﬁc or technical nature (including software docu- mentation) relating to supplies procured by an agency. Technical data does not include com- puter software or ﬁnancial, administrative, cost or pricing, or management data or other infor- mation incidental to contract administration. This deﬁnition includes engineering data, source data and TO data (for example, schematic dia- grams, ﬂow diagrams, manufacturer handbooks, manuscripts of O&M instructions, PTOs, com- mercial TMs, Research and Development (R&D) TMs, and other system or equipment O&M procedures developed under AFMC or other acquisition agency directions during the system acquisition phase). Avoid use of this term when referring to speciﬁc types of data. 2. (DODD 2040.2,International Transfers of Tech- nology, Goods, Services, and Munitions, deﬁni- tion) - Classiﬁed or unclassiﬁed information of any kind that can be used, or adapted for use, in the design, production, manufacture, repair, overhaul, processing, engineering, development, operation, maintenance, or reconstruction of goods or munitions; or any technology that ad- vances the state of the art or establishes a new art in an area of signiﬁcant military applicability in the United States. The data may be tangible, such as a model, prototype, blueprint, or an op- erating manual, or may be intangible, such as a technical service or oral or visual interactions.  Technical Manual Contract Requirement  (TMCR) Document, TM 86-01: The document approved for use by the Department of the Air Force to acquire TOs. It fully describes state- ment of work criteria for contractor program management, TO Quality Assurance, TO devel- opment and update, TCTOs, delivery instruc- tions, and generic tailoring of the approved stan- dards and speciﬁcations.  Technical Order (TO): TMs developed to MIL- SPECs or commercial manuals reviewed and approved in accordance with MIL-PRF-32216, managed in the Air Force TO System, and meeting the criteria for TMs listed above. The term Technical Order is equivalent to the DoD term Technical Manual.  Technical Order Distribute and Print Gateway (TODPG): TODPG provides TOMAs interface to upload and manage TO content within TODPS.  A-26 ', 'TO 00-5-3  like Interim TOs. Operational PTO ﬁles will contain only those RCs/updates which apply to that organization; reference ﬁles may contain all RCs/updates applicable to the command.  3-29 ', 'TO 00-5-3  Office (AFLCMC Managed Programs Only) and HQ AFMC/A4F, 4375 Chidlaw Rd Suite 6, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-5006, email: afmc.a4.af.topp@us.af.mil, for possible incorporation into the TMCR.  2.1.4.7.2 Ensure all requested TMSS waivers and deviations are controlled and documented. All program waiver requests will be submitted IAW Paragraph 1.2.1. AFMC/A4F will coordinate requests with AFLCMC/HIAM for possible incorpora- tion into affected documents. The TOMA will also ensure any contractor proposals to use commercial, Non-Government Speciﬁcations (NGS) follow the same procedures above. These NGS will be reviewed and approved by HQ AFMC/A4F and by AFLCMC/HIAM.  2.1.4.7.3 Early in the TO acquisition program, use the ETIMS Request TO Number process to obtain new TO numbers from the Numbering Specialists (IAW TO 00-5-18). EXCEPTION: 11N TO numbers are managed by AFNWC/NC. ICBM will submit numbering requests to AFLCMC/LZPTP-TINKER IAW TO 00-5-18. As Preliminary TOs are developed, index them in ETIMS so prospective users can begin establishing subscriptions. For each new TO category, the TOMA will establish a TCTO Series Header and electronic TCTO (eTCTO) Series Header for the program’s TOs. (Chapter 4).  2.1.4.8 Plan, conduct and co-chair all TO conferences, meetings, reviews, and other joint agency efforts related to the TO acquisition program (Chapter 3). Coordinate with the MAJCOM and support agencies to ensure their participation in all TO acquisition activities. Request contracting officer representation in meetings with the contractor as required.  2.1.4.9 Evaluate the contractor’s certiﬁcation process (Chapter 3 ) (IMP entrance and exit criteria, site visits, past perfor- mance) during proposal evaluation. Ensure TO development processes have adequate checks and balances, and procedures to cover standardization of writing. Ensure prime contractors levy certiﬁcation requirements on vendors and subcontractors.  2.1.4.10 Provide the Responsible Test Organization (RTO) with PTOs to use during Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) or TO veriﬁcation.  2.1.4.10.1 Support the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) with PTOs and other materials for training pro- grams. The TO development effort will not be accelerated solely to furnish PTOs for training purposes.  2.1.4.10.2 During acquisition, deliver copies of preliminary data to verifying units prior to the scheduled veriﬁcation or in-process review. Advance delivery requirements shall be deﬁned in the TMCR and TOLCVP. For veriﬁcation of TO updates during sustainment, deliver draft updates to the verifying unit as early as possible before the scheduled veriﬁcation.  2.1.4.11 Coordinate with other PM functions, and the MAJCOM(s) to ensure that TOs are compatible with the eTO viewer, computer programs and equipment used in the maintenance and operation of systems and commodities.  2.1.4.12 During acquisition, ensure that TO technical content, method of presentation, style and level of writing are in line with the established maintenance concept, and within the skills and training of personnel projected to operate and maintain the equipment. That is, TOs comply with the Technical and System Requirements Documents (TRD/SRD) and applicable TO MIL-SPECs. Ensure existing source data is used to the maximum extent possible and is not duplicated for TO develop- ment. Review source data to detect errors, deﬁciencies and nonessential material.  2.1.4.13 Establish and manage a quality Air Force Veriﬁcation Program. Develop a TOLCVP (see TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531) no less than 120 days prior to the scheduled start of veriﬁcation. Involve all appropriate government and contractor agencies. Coordinate with the MAJCOM to obtain personnel to perform the tasks to be veriﬁed. Develop and submit adequate budgets to support veriﬁcation.  2.1.4.14 Document the CFAE/CFE and Support Equipment Recommendation Data (SERD) review processes in the TOLCMP. Review and, in coordination with the MAJCOM and support agencies, recommend contractual approval or disapproval of CFAE/CFE Notices (DI-TMSS-80067) recommending program manuals. Review SERD for any TO impacts.  2.1.4.15 Develop budget requirements for TO acquisition and sustainment. Temporary Duty (TDY) expenses incurred as a result of attending TO acquisition or management functions will be funded IAW AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures. Budget inputs will include modiﬁcation-related TO update integration costs and the removal of before and after data.  2.1.4.15.1 Identify TO technical requirements to Lead Commands; prepare CAFTOP Narratives and TO Information Sheet (TOIS). Manage TO technical requirements as documented in the CAFTOP Handbook. This handbook is located at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10792/default.aspx.

Errata sheets may be processed for AF POD (TODPG) TOs. If the problem requiring errata sheets is due to printing problems, DLA Data Management Services will reprint and distribute the corrected TO or increment at their cost. If the problem is due to administrative errors or incomplete reproducible PDF masters, the TOMA will provide an errata package to the TODPG and fund for its reproduction and distribution. Prepare the errata package including cover sheet and pages for distribution as a PDF ﬁle. Refer to ETIMS Errata FUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531 for procedures.  5.7 OFFICIAL AIR FORCE TECHNICAL ORDER ARCHIVES.  5.7.1 Business Practices. One copy of every published TO and TCTO increment (Basic, revision, change and supple- ment) must be preserved in an official Air Force TO Archive to comply with record retention provisions of the Federal Records Act and to ensure preservation for Air Force needs. Archived ﬁles will only be the digital or printing source ﬁle (.pdf).  5.7.2 TOs are held for 6 years after they are rescinded, contracts are closed and the supported equipment is dropped from AF inventory (Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/, Table 33-40, Spe- cialized Publications ; Rule 3, Technical Orders). Program offices will coordinate with their applicable TOMA to establish a TO archive. All programs will document their archive processes within their TO Life Cycle Management Plan. See EXCEPTIONS in Paragraph 5.7.2.8  5.7.2.1 The official archive for all Hill AFB TO management programs is the Comprehensive Integrated Technical Order Management System (CITOMS).  5.7.2.2 The official archive for all Robins AFB TO management programs is the Centralized TO Repository (CTOR).  5.7.2.3 Programs utilizing IDM with content management may use the IDM environment as the archive.  5.7.2.4 The official classiﬁed digital archive is Robins Secure TO Repository (STOR).  5.7.2.5 All AF TOs in the 11N index will be officially archived by AFNWC.  5.7.2.6 Programs not currently using one of the above archive repositories will establish archive capability with Robins AFB CTOR. Contact the Robins TO Site Functional Office for assistance. (Appendix B)  5.7.2.7 All requests for archival TOs will be performed IAW TO 00-5-1, para 3.4.  5.7.2.8 EXCEPTIONS: JNWPS TOs managed by AFNWC/NCL are archived by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). DTRA also archives nuclear EOD TOs. See Chapter 7 for archive procedures for JNWPS TOs.  5.7.3 Tinker Archive is no longer required to maintain physical TOs; paper, CD, DVD, regardless of the TO status, i.e., active, rescinded, renumbered, or superseded. EXCEPTION: FMS-Only status TOs and TOs with FMS ID. All physical media TOs will be dispositioned by TOMA offices accordingly, i.e., speciﬁed to destroy or retain. For election to retain TO, shipping funds and manpower will be required; for election to destroy TO, TOMAs must ensure a digital copy is archived per Paragraph 5.7.2.  5-10 ']
