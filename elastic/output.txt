The TOMA initiates this process for TOs by reviewing program documentation and developing a preliminary plan of action. The TOMA will review the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), Capability Development Document (CDD), Operational Concept, Maintenance Concept, and other documents to determine the correct acquisition strategy for each new program. This strategy should be reﬂected in the TO Life Cycle Management Plan (TOLCMP), wording for the Statement of Objective (SOO), Evaluation Criteria, and Instructions to Offeror.', 'The TOMA is responsible for estimating the cost of TOs needed to support the military system or commodity. The cost of acquiring TOs includes writing, editing, supporting conferences and reviews, veriﬁcation, preparation of reproducible masters, printing and distribution, routine maintenance, and TO-related travel (AFI 65-601V1). TO costs are chargeable to the same budget program activity code used to ﬁnance hardware costs during initial acquisition. The TOMA must begin the cost estimating process shortly after assignment to ensure adequate program funds are available. All information sources should be explored, including, but not limited to, historical data from other programs, contractor estimates, and prior experience. The PM must ensure the annual program budget submission includes TO requirements.', 'the written direction of the PM, the TOMA is responsible for managing some or all of the TOs for a speciﬁc military system or commodity program for the entire life cycle. Management responsibilities typically include acquisition, sustainment, format, publishing, storage, distribution and archiving of TOs and related technical data IAW AFPD 63-1/AFPD 20-1, AFI 63-101/20-101, AFMCI 21-301, AFMCMAN 21-1 and 00-5-series TOs. TOMAs will:', 'The responsible TOMA will:', 'It is the responsibility of the TOMA to request and assign TO numbers early in the TO acquisition program. TOMAs are responsible for requesting numbers for assigned TOs, using the ETIMS Request TO Number screen and the guidance in TO 00-5-18. As Preliminary TOs are developed, the TOMA shall index them in ETIMS so prospective users can begin establishing subscriptions. This includes IETM/S1000D based TOs. For each new TO category, the TOMA will establish a TCTO Series Header and electronic TCTO (eTCTO) Series Header for the program’s TOs. Whenever a paper TCTO series header is requested and created, a corresponding electronic TCTO (eTCTO) series header should be requested and created.']
