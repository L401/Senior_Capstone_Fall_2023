CODE DEFINITION
S No repair. Identifies items which are not repairable or are considered uneconomical to repair. These parts
will be disposed of at user level upon failure.
B Recondition. No repair authorized. Assigned to items to be reconditioned at user level by adjusting,
cleaning, welding, straightening, etc. No repair parts or tools are procured for maintenance support. Re-
conditioning will be achieved by using common bench stock parts, materials, standard tools, and shop
equipment. If beyond restoration by these means, items will be condemned and disposed of at user level.
F Intermediate Repair. Identifies items to be repaired at the intermediate level of maintenance. Selected
parts, tools, technical data, and test equipment are provided for repair support. If the item cannot be re-
paired with authorized parts and tools, it will be disposed of as condemned material. If repair cannot be
accomplished due to the absence of parts, tools, etc., disposition instructions will be requested from the
responsible IM. Critical and potentially critical items will be returned to base supply for disposition as
directed by the IM. (NOTE: No TRC is established for “F” coded items.)
