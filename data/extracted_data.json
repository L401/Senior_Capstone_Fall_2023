In every case, there are mandatory events and requirements which must be met to successfully \ufb01eld the new equipment in a supportable manner. The following paragraphs outline a typical TO acquisition program for a new system. Programs of lesser scope (e.g., commodities or modi\ufb01cation of existing equipment) may not require all steps or functions. Working in conjunction with the Program Manager (PM) and Product Support Manager (PSM), the TO Management Agency/Agent (TOMA) is responsible for executing and managing the TO program. TOMAs are members of the program office Integrated Product Team (IPT) and will determine how the TO acquisition program will be implemented depending upon the people involved and the complexity of the program. For all acquisition efforts, the TOMA should be designated as early as possible to plan the TO development.": "",

            "Events and meetings associated with TO acquisitions are described below. All or some of these events/meetings may be required for programs with TO requirements depending upon the complexity of the program.

Data Management is an important part of Life-Cycle Logistics. In that context, Data Management consists of the disciplined processes and systems that plan for, acquire and/or access, manage, and use data throughout the total system life cycle.",
            "3.3.1.4 Data Management De\ufb01ned.": "Data Management is de\ufb01ned as the process of applying policies, systems and procedures for identi\ufb01cation and control of data requirements; for the timely and economical acquisition of such data; for assuring the adequacy of data; for the access, distribution or communication of the data to the point of use; and for analysis of data use. This section concentrates on technical, product, and logistics data in support of the development, production, operation, sustainment, improvement, demilitarization and disposal of a system. This includes both government and contrac- tor created data.",
            "3.3.1.5 Strategy.": "The PM should develop a long-term strategy that integrates data requirements across all functional disciplines to include logistics. A performance-based approach should be used to identify the minimal data required to cost-effectively operate, maintain and improve the \ufb01elded system and to foster source of support competition throughout the system life cycle. Data should be available in a format that is compatible with the intended user\u2019s environment and a quality assurance program should be implemented to guarantee the accuracy and completeness of the data. The PM should assess the long-term needs for technical data rights to support weapon systems and correspondingly, to develop acquisition strate- gies that address those needs. Because a weapon system may remain in the defense inventory for decades, the decisions made at the time of acquisition can have far-reaching implications for weapon system support over the system\u2019s life cycle, and the failure to negotiate adequate technical data rights may impede the government\u2019s ability to sustain the weapons system. It is during the development of the solicitation and the subsequent negotiation of a proposed contract that the government is in the best position to negotiate and secure required technical data rights. The PM should consider requiring an acquisition strategy that provides for a future delivery of sufficient technical data should the need arise to select an alternative source or to offer the work out for competition.",
            "3.3.1.6 Access vs. Delivery.": "In many cases, leaving government acquired data in the physical possession of the contrac- tor and having access to the contractor\u2019s data system is the ideal solution. In addition to data access, the requirement for government use, reproduction, manipulation, altering or transfer of possession of data should be part of the data acquisition and management strategy. The contract should specify appropriate government rights to the data acquired, in addition to requirements for delivery or access. Data, whenever it is delivered to the government, should be formatted in accordance with accepted data standards to ensure usability by the government. A list of data standard examples can be found in the Air Force TMCR on the TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. These decisions should be made early in the acquisition life cycle to avoid unexpected costs to procure, reformat and deliver data.",
            "3.3.1.7 Protecting Data.": "Whether the data is stored and managed by the government or by industry, the PM is respon- sible for protecting system data. Policy applicable to data protection, marking, and release can be found in the following: DoDI 5230.24, DoDD 5230.25, DoDM 5400.07, and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) Part 252.227-7013 & 7014. The Air Force implementing instruction is AFI 61-201",
            "3.3.1.8 Additional Guidance.": "Industry standards from organizations such as the Government Electronics and Information Association (GEIA), International Standards Organization (ISO) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI), provide high level principles to guide integrated data management planning, and implementation. The GEIA Handbook ANSI GEIA-859, Data Management Standard , is a guide that may be helpful for PMs and data managers. This handbook outlines principles and processes for the management of data including data interoperability and longevity, best practices, and long term electronic storage, use, and recovery of data.",
            "3.3.2 Program Planning.": "The \ufb01rst step in any program or project is to determine the scope and requirements. The TOMA initiates this process for TOs by reviewing program documentation and developing a preliminary plan of action. The TOMA will review the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), Capability Development Document (CDD), Operational Concept, Maintenance Concept, and other documents to determine the correct acquisition strategy for each new program. This strategy should be re\ufb02ected in the TO Life Cycle Management Plan (TOLCMP), wording for the Statement of Objective (SOO), Evaluation Criteria, and Instructions to Offeror.",

AF TO Programs desiring to implement S1000D/IETM initiatives shall utilize all available/applicable AF (APL) tools and resources for the implementation and organic sustainment of IETM/S1000D tech data, i.e., Content Management System (CMS), distribution and COTS/GOTS viewing software, etc. Systems and/or tools provided by the contractor shall be made interoperable with AF infrastructure/technology. The TOLCMP is developed by the TOMA, then coordinated and approved at the TO Planning/Requirements Conference (TOP/RC) by the TO IPT members. It outlines management policies and procedures for the development, acquisition, reproduction, distribu- tion and archive procedures of TOs on any military system or commodity program throughout the program and entire TO life cycle. The TOLCMP must address timely acquisition of PTOs or source data with a format and depth of coverage adequate to support test activities. Air Force TO proponents for joint DoD and international weapon system acquisition programs shall develop and maintain copies of the AF TOLCMP and TOLCVP for the life of the program. The TOLCMP shall be attached to the Weapon System Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP). The TOLCMP is not a static management document and shall be reviewed annually and updated as required by the TOMA during the Comprehensive Air Force Technical Order Plan (CAFTOP) update.

Evaluation criteria must support the SOO and be traceable to the Instruction to Offerors sections. The SOO is a government-prepared attachment to either Section J or L of the RFP. The SOO provides the basic, top-level objectives of the acquisition program. Additionally, program objectives focus on the higher risk areas individually, so each area can be addressed directly in the evaluation criteria. These higher risk areas are usually valid discriminators in the source selection process. Areas of relatively low risk are generally covered by higher level objectives. The SOO allows the offeror maximum \ufb02exibility to develop cost-effective solutions and to propose innovative alternatives to meet the stated objectives. The SOO also allows the government to assess offeror understanding of the effort to be performed, by eliminating the how to instructions typically provided in a SOW, (MIL-HDBK-245, Preparation of Statement of Work (SOW)).",
            "3.7.1.2 Phrasing Objectives.": "Depending on the level of risk, TO objectives will be addressed in a variety of ways. For most acquisition programs, the TO objective would be covered with a statement such as: Provide quality technical manuals, source data and options for the government to obtain data acquisition rights to support the objective of Air Force organic system operation and \ufb01eld and depot-level maintenance for the system life cycle. Actual wording will depend on program operations and maintenance concepts. Where TOs are considered a low-risk area, TO objectives may be covered by the more general logistics support objective.",

The TOMA should be knowledgeable in all relevant areas of TO acquisition or sustainment, and must thor- oughly understand program requirements, the RFP, and the evaluation criteria. Assistance and comments should be solicited from appropriate PM or staff agency personnel if some parts of the proposal are beyond TOMA expertise and experience. During competitive contract bidding, the TOMA must not contact any bidder directly. There must be no bias or any appearance of con\ufb02ict of interest.",

Section M informs offerors how the government will evaluate and rank proposals. For TOs, a primary criterion is development IAW Air Force TMSS to ensure ETIMS compat- ibility. Other criteria include complete program coverage, acceptable in-house processes to ensure delivery of technically accurate documents and data, past performance and support of government veri\ufb01cation.",
            "3.8.1.2 Developing Evaluation Criteria and Checklists.": "Documented criteria must be developed from program require- ments prior to RFP release. These evaluation criteria (or a checklist), must be used to analyze any proposals. The criteria should list the requirements in rank order and establish the minimum acceptable level of compliance for a proposal to be considered acceptable, consistent with the evaluation factors. The criteria may be either quantitative or qualitative depending upon the factors or sub-factors addressed. The criteria will allow all proposals submitted against an RFP to be evaluated to the same standards and help to prevent any charges of bias or unfair practices. The TOMA, in conjunction with the IPT, will develop TO program evaluation criteria.",

The evaluation should assess offeror understanding of and ability to comply with program requirements based on the proposal, Contractor Performance Assessment Reports (CPAR, available from the PCO) or site surveys, interviews, etc. The quality of the contractor processes and ability to provide an acceptable product are primary concerns. The principal TOMA role is to evaluate the technical merit of the TO portion of the proposal.",

Because the Air Force may not have the capability to perform an engineering evaluation of suggested changes during acquisition, the contractor is often tasked to provide this support. Normally, a TO Review Board (TORB) and Flight TO Review Board (FTORB) are established to review, approve and determine veri\ufb01cation requirements for all proposed PTO updates.

In addition, emergency includes discrepancies that directly affect the handling, maintenance, operations, transportation, testing, and testing or storage of nuclear weapons. The TOMA/TCM or designated representative must provide written corrective action or downgrade the RC within 48 hours (72 hours for work stoppage) of receipt.",

            "3.16 OVERVIEW.": "",
            "There are a lot of parallels between major acquisition programs and smaller acquisition programs; the main difference is the overall cost of these programs and the degree to which each type of program relates to the events or milestones. For example, both types of program will require some degree of acquisition strategy and some acquisition planning, the main difference is, there is far more planning required for a large aircraft development program, than for a small hydraulic jack program. Also, many of the smaller programs typically do not require all of the same number of personnel to administer the program. Major events which have a direct effect on smaller TO programs are included below.": "",
            "3.16.1 Data Call.": "Used by Program Offices to solicit requirements for smaller programs. These events replaced the more structured Data Requirements Review Boards in many instances. The TOMA is a key player along with the IPT members in determining the scope and depth of each new program. Data calls are an integral part of the requirements development process.",
            "3.16.2 Technical Manual Contract Requirements (TMCRs). Technical": "manuals requirements are similar in both Major and Minor acquisitions. Refer to Paragraph 3.6.1 for a further explanation.",

            "3.16.3.1": "The TOMA may include draft CDRLs for known data requirements in the RFP. The CDRL for TO delivery (if included), with the TMCR attached, will be referenced in RFP section J. The Instruction to Offerors will require the offerors to develop SOW paragraphs, complete CDRL tailoring and submit any other suggested data requirement CDRLs with the proposals.",
            "3.16.3.2": "If CDRLs are not included in the RFP, the Instruction to Offerors will require offerors to propose all data requirements, including TOs. In this case, a partly-tailored TMCR may be placed in either the system speci\ufb01cation or the Proposal Technical Library.",
            "3.16.3.3 Justi\ufb01cation.": "Offerors must justify each data requirement included in proposals. The TOMA or program data manager will complete DD Form 1423 (CDRLs) for approved requirements. See DoD 5010.12-M for DD Form 1423 instructions.",

TOMA partici- pation remains the same whatever the reason for negotiations, and must be performed through the PCO.",
            "3.16.4.2 Additional Evaluations.": "Evaluate ECPs, associated TCTOs, and CCPs against the baseline contract to ensure costs correspond to the original proposal and were not included in the baseline costs. Some TO updates as a result of ECPs should be included in the routine periodic update program, and some proposed additions to the number of TOs developed or acquired may be included in contract baselines. Evaluate the ECPs/CCPs against similar items previously submitted by the contractor.",
            "3.16.4.3 Contract Adjustments.": "If, for any reason, the contractor does not perform some functions as originally proposed (for example, when schedules are accelerated and revised need dates prevent some quality checks, or vital support equipment will not be available in time), an equitable adjustment to the contract/order price should be negotiated. The PCO will manage negotiations and may or may not require TOMA support.",
            "3.16.4.4 Guidance Conference/Post Award Conference.": "The IPT, with the contractor included, holds a Guidance Conference or a Post Award Conference where program plans are reviewed and approved, and schedules are established. The timing is usually within 60 days after contract award to avoid delaying contractor tasks. The contractor can initiate TO preparation after the TO guidance conference.
