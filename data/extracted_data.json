(Reference Chapter 4) TO sustainment refers to all activities required to maintain the currency,\naccuracy, and availability of USAF TOs, Country Standard Technical Orders (CSTOs) and M-Symbol TOs in the post-\nacquisition phases of a program life cycle. It includes TO updating, verifying, indexing, con\ufb01guration control, storing,\narchiving, distributing, superseding, rescinding, and reactivating. This includes the TOs necessary for, or associated with,\nreclamation, re-use, and cannibalization of the system and its associated commodities. Continuing support for FMS custom-\ners is also part of TO sustainment.\n\n1.3 TECHNICAL ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTION TOOLS.\n\nAll TO system data input, management practices, and TO acquisition, sustainment and use procedures will be performed\nusing ETIMS and AF-sanctioned interfacing program tools. Exceptions are listed in TO 00-5-1 and this TO.\n\n1.3.1 Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS). ETIMS, a secure web GCSS-AF application\naccessible via the AF portal, is the AF TO System of Record. ETIMS functions include TO cataloging, ordering and TO\nDistribution Office (TODO) account management support. ETIMS is used to acquire, improve, publish, catalog, manage,\nstore, distribute and display the official TOs needed for the safe and effective operation of AF weapon systems and equip-\nment. ETIMS users are assigned roles that include a set of system privileges using a speci\ufb01c role to provide capability to\nperform various functions. ETIMS interfaces with two other components of the AF Standard TO Management System;\nTechnical Order Distribution Print Gateway (TODPG) and Security Assistance TO Data System (SATODS). ETIMS also\nfeatures an active eTO content repository, an eTO publisher/transformer, and an eTO viewer with online (connected) and\nportable (disconnected) modes. Primary users are TOMAs, TODO personnel, TO Distribution Account (TODA) personnel,\nTO Library Custodians, and eTool administrators. To access ETIMS, prospective users must \ufb01rst obtain a CAC or an\nExternal Certi\ufb01cate Authority (ECA) with a minimum of a favorable National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) to\nestablish access to the AF Portal. Once logged on to the AF Portal home page, ETIMS is accessed from the Application A-Z\nListing.\n\n1.3.2 Automated Technical Order System (ATOS). ATOS is a loose-leaf publication and document management sys-\ntem for developing, maintaining and sustaining Air Force TOs. ATOS receives, stores and maintains digital TOs and TO\nchange page data and is capable of producing Adobe\u00ae Portable Document Format (PDF) output to meet POD requirements.\nATOS consists of seven subsystems; production control, text capture, text generation, graphics capture, graphics generation,\nreview and output. ATOS has the capability to convert technical data from a paper source to Standard Generalized Markup\nLanguage (SGML) and accept SGML deliveries from outside sources. The SGML output data is Technical Manual Speci\ufb01-\ncations and Standards (TMSS) compliant.\n\nNOTE\n\n\u2022 The ATOS system is being consolidated with the Integrated Data for Maintenance (IDM) and will continue to\nbe known as ATOS, a component of the AF Standard TO Management System. The tech-refreshed ATOS\nsystem will provide AF enterprise capability to manage, author and publish TO publication source content data;\ne.g., AF TMSS SGML / S1000D XML. The enterprise tech-refreshed ATOS system will be the preferred\nsystem for managing vendor / OEM delivered TO source content and for organic TO Authoring and Publishing\n(TOAP).\n\n\u2022 TO programs are encouraged to work with their TO Home, Site Functional Offices and ATOS offices to help\nplan migration strategies. All ATOS TO content data must be migrated to the tech-refreshed ATOS by 30 Sept\n2019. ATOS TO content not migrated by September 2019 will be archived on the consolidated TOAP System\nand will require a Revision to be prepared when an approved AFTO Form 252, Publication Change Request is\npublished.\n\n\u2022 TO Programs currently using contractor or other organic editorial capabilities are encouraged to evaluate the\n\ntech-refreshed ATOS capabilities to reduce TO program costs.\n\n1.3.3 Product Support Tool Kit (PSTK) (formerly A&S Tool Kit). The PSTK Tool Kit is designed to provide standard,\nrepeatable processes to guide the acquisition and sustainment workforce and facilitate life cycle up front planning and\nprogramming.

In every case, there are mandatory events and requirements which must be met to successfully \ufb01eld the new\nequipment in a supportable manner. The following paragraphs outline a typical TO acquisition program for a new system.\nPrograms of lesser scope (e.g., commodities or modi\ufb01cation of existing equipment) may not require all steps or functions.\nWorking in conjunction with the Program Manager (PM) and Product Support Manager (PSM), the TO Management\nAgency/Agent (TOMA) is responsible for executing and managing the TO program. TOMAs are members of the program\noffice Integrated Product Team (IPT) and will determine how the TO acquisition program will be implemented depending\nupon the people involved and the complexity of the program. For all acquisition efforts, the TOMA should be designated as\nearly as possible to plan the TO development.\n\n3.2 EVENTS AND MEETINGS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNICAL ORDER ACQUISITIONS.\n\nEvents and meetings associated with TO acquisitions are described below. All or some of these events/meetings may be\nrequired for programs with TO requirements depending upon the complexity of the program. TOMAs must be familiar with\nall acquisition events/meetings regardless of their current workloads. TOMAs should be aware of new systems or programs,\nupdates and changes to systems, and personnel transfers which can impact their workload. Being knowledgeable of TO\nacquisition and sustainment policies will make these transitions much easier. Reference DoD 5010.12-M, Procedures for the\nAcquisition and Management of Technical Data.\n\n3.3 ACQUISITION STRATEGY.\n\nAcquisition strategy is the responsibility of the PM/SPM assigned to oversee each program. The TOMA must become very\nfamiliar with the approach to be taken with each program, for the initial \ufb01elding, levels of maintenance, style and format for\nrequired TO publications, schedules, funding, and all aspects of the TO program as it relates to the overall program. Planning\nand knowing how each of these events impact TO management and development is crucial in avoiding any problems later in\nthe program.\n\n3.3.1 Data and Data Management (Ref: Defense Acquisition Guidebook).\n\nNOTE\n\nDoD policies and procedures for data and data management in this section are directly applicable to procedures\nfor technical order development and management in this TO. Italicized statements were added for clarity.\n\n3.3.1.1 De\ufb01nition. Data are de\ufb01ned as recorded information regardless of the form or method of recording. The term\nincludes technical data (including TOs ), computer software documentation, management information, representation of\nfacts, numbers, or datum of any nature that can be communicated, stored, and processed to form information required by a\ncontract or agreement to be delivered, or accessed by, the government. The term includes similar information generated\ndirectly by government activities, as well. The data are used to gain insight and provide management and guidance to system\ndevelopment programs.\n\n3.3.1.2 Scope. For purposes of this TO, data refers to the TOs and source data necessary for or associated with product\ndevelopment and sustainment, including the data associated with system development; modeling and simulation used in\ndevelopment or test; test and evaluation; installation; parts; spares; repairs; usage data required for product sustainment;\nsource and/or supplier data; reclamation; re-use; and cannibalization of the system and its associated commodities. Data\nspeci\ufb01cally not included would be data relating to tactical operations information; sensor or communications information;\n\ufb01nancial transactions; personnel data; transactional data; and other data of a purely business nature.\n\n3-1\n",

        "subheader": "TO 00-5-3\n\n3.3.1.3 Total Life Cycle Systems Management (TLCSM). Under TLCSM, the PM is responsible for Data Management\nfor the system throughout its life cycle. Data Management is an important part of Life-Cycle Logistics. In that context, Data\nManagement consists of the disciplined processes and systems that plan for, acquire and/or access, manage, and use data\nthroughout the total system life cycle.\n\n3.3.1.4 Data Management De\ufb01ned. Data Management is de\ufb01ned as the process of applying policies, systems and\nprocedures for identi\ufb01cation and control of data requirements; for the timely and economical acquisition of such data; for\nassuring the adequacy of data; for the access, distribution or communication of the data to the point of use; and for analysis\nof data use. This section concentrates on technical, product, and logistics data in support of the development, production,\noperation, sustainment, improvement, demilitarization and disposal of a system. This includes both government and contrac-\ntor created data.\n\n3.3.1.5 Strategy. The PM should develop a long-term strategy that integrates data requirements across all functional\ndisciplines to include logistics. A performance-based approach should be used to identify the minimal data required to\ncost-effectively operate, maintain and improve the \ufb01elded system and to foster source of support competition throughout the\nsystem life cycle. Data should be available in a format that is compatible with the intended user\u2019s environment and a quality\nassurance program should be implemented to guarantee the accuracy and completeness of the data. The PM should assess\nthe long-term needs for technical data rights to support weapon systems and correspondingly, to develop acquisition strate-\ngies that address those needs. Because a weapon system may remain in the defense inventory for decades, the decisions\nmade at the time of acquisition can have far-reaching implications for weapon system support over the system\u2019s life cycle,\nand the failure to negotiate adequate technical data rights may impede the government\u2019s ability to sustain the weapons\nsystem. It is during the development of the solicitation and the subsequent negotiation of a proposed contract that the\ngovernment is in the best position to negotiate and secure required technical data rights. The PM should consider requiring\nan acquisition strategy that provides for a future delivery of sufficient technical data should the need arise to select an\nalternative source or to offer the work out for competition.\n\n3.3.1.6 Access vs. Delivery. In many cases, leaving government acquired data in the physical possession of the contrac-\ntor and having access to the contractor\u2019s data system is the ideal solution. In addition to data access, the requirement for\ngovernment use, reproduction, manipulation, altering or transfer of possession of data should be part of the data acquisition\nand management strategy. The contract should specify appropriate government rights to the data acquired, in addition to\nrequirements for delivery or access. Data, whenever it is delivered to the government, should be formatted in accordance\nwith accepted data standards to ensure usability by the government. A list of data standard examples can be found in the Air\nForce TMCR on the TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. These decisions should be made early in the\nacquisition life cycle to avoid unexpected costs to procure, reformat and deliver data.\n\n3.3.1.7 Protecting Data. Whether the data is stored and managed by the government or by industry, the PM is respon-\nsible for protecting system data. Policy applicable to data protection, marking, and release can be found in the following:\nDoDI 5230.24, DoDD 5230.25, DoDM 5400.07, and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) Part\n252.227-7013 & 7014. The Air Force implementing instruction is AFI 61-201\n\n3.3.1.8 Additional Guidance. Industry standards from organizations such as the Government Electronics and Information\nAssociation (GEIA), International Standards Organization (ISO) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI), provide\nhigh level principles to guide integrated data management planning, and implementation. The GEIA Handbook ANSI\nGEIA-859, Data Management Standard , is a guide that may be helpful for PMs and data managers. This handbook outlines\nprinciples and processes for the management of data including data interoperability and longevity, best practices, and long\nterm electronic storage, use, and recovery of data.\n\n3.3.2 Program Planning. The \ufb01rst step in any program or project is to determine the scope and requirements. The TOMA\ninitiates this process for TOs by reviewing program documentation and developing a preliminary plan of action. The TOMA\nwill review the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), Capability Development Document (CDD), Operational Concept,\nMaintenance Concept, and other documents to determine the correct acquisition strategy for each new program. This strategy\nshould be re\ufb02ected in the TO Life Cycle Management Plan (TOLCMP), wording for the Statement of Objective (SOO),\nEvaluation Criteria, and Instructions to Offeror.\n\n3.3.2.1 Technical Order Life Cycle Management Plan (TOLCMP). A TOLCMP is mandatory for all programs not\nexempt from the USAF TO System (IAW TO 00-5-1) when TOs must be developed or are impacted. When multiple\nprograms are managed within the same program office, one TOLCMP may be developed and updated, as required, to de\ufb01ne\nspeci\ufb01c program requirements for each effort. The TOLCMP shall include a TO Concept of Operations (TO CONOPS)\nde\ufb01ning the user vision for operation and use of TOs being developed and how the TOs will support operations and\nmaintenance of the system. The TO CONOPS should also be included as part of the TM 86-01, Technical Manual Contract\n\n3-2\n",

The TOLCMP\nis developed by the TOMA, then coordinated and approved at the TO Planning/Requirements Conference (TOP/RC) by the\nTO IPT members. It outlines management policies and procedures for the development, acquisition, reproduction, distribu-\ntion and archive procedures of TOs on any military system or commodity program throughout the program and entire TO\nlife cycle. The TOLCMP must address timely acquisition of PTOs or source data with a format and depth of coverage\nadequate to support test activities. Air Force TO proponents for joint DoD and international weapon system acquisition\nprograms shall develop and maintain copies of the AF TOLCMP and TOLCVP for the life of the program. The TOLCMP\nshall be attached to the Weapon System Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP). The TOLCMP is not a static management\ndocument and shall be reviewed annually and updated as required by the TOMA during the Comprehensive Air Force\nTechnical Order Plan (CAFTOP) update. Copies of the TOLCMP and all updates shall also be sent to the TO Site Functional\nOffice at the PM location. See generic TOLCMP\u2019s on the TOMA SharePoint site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).\n\n3.3.2.2 Technical Order Life Cycle Veri\ufb01cation Plan (TOLCVP). Veri\ufb01cation is the formal process by which Air Force\npersonnel evaluate and prove new TOs developed during acquisition and TO updates developed during sustainment are\naccurate, adequate, safe, and usable in the operational environment to support the program. Planning for veri\ufb01cation of TOs\nshall be initiated at the TO Planning/Requirements Conference (or by the TOMA if no conference is held), based upon the\nneeds of the MAJCOM and other affected agencies. The TOLCVP is mandatory for all programs and should be developed as\nsoon as possible in the acquisition program. For programs with multiple modi\ufb01cations, the TOLCVP should be updated to\ncover any unique procedures, processes and schedule required. Preparation of a complete new TOLCVP for each modi\ufb01ca-\ntion program is not required provided the base system TOLCVP adequately addresses the veri\ufb01cation process to be used.\nLike the TOLCMP, the TOLCVP is not a static management document and shall be reviewed annually and updated as\nrequired by the TOMA during the CAFTOP update. When a TOLCMP is developed, the TOLCVP will be an attachment to\nthe TOLCMP. The TOLCVP shall include identi\ufb01cation of procedures to be veri\ufb01ed, the veri\ufb01cation site, the Veri\ufb01cation\nTeam Manager (VTM), support equipment and consumables required, schedules, use of substitute equipment and veri\ufb01cation\nprocedures and processes. The TOLCVP shall cover documentation processes and procedures for the veri\ufb01cation activities.\nThe TOLCVP shall also be updated to cover the processes and procedures to be used to verify TO updates after the TO is\nformalized and enters the sustainment phase of the TO life cycle. If contractor support is required during veri\ufb01cation, the\nrequirements for support shall be de\ufb01ned in the TMCR. See the generic TOLCVP on the TOMA SharePoint site (https://\ncs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531) Copies of the TOLCVP and all updates shall also be sent to the TO Site Functional Office at the\nPM location.\n\n3.3.2.2.1 The program veri\ufb01cation schedule must be developed in conjunction with the Air Force test plan, production\nschedules and deployment schedules to ensure the availability of hardware, software, and equipment to support the veri\ufb01-\ncation effort. If available, the tentative schedule should be provided to offerors in the Request for Proposal (RFP) to allow\ndevelopment of supportive schedules.\n\n3.3.2.2.2 TO veri\ufb01cation will make maximum use of other scheduled events, such as test and evaluation, prototyping, and\nmaintainability demonstrations. Activities should not be duplicated. Use unscheduled events such as equipment failure to\nverify applicable procedures, when possible.\n\n3.3.2.3 Contractor Developed Technical Manual Organization Plan (TMOP). The contract may include the develop-\nment and delivery of a TMOP through the use of Data Item DI-TMSS-81810. The contractor TMOP does not, however,\nreplace the requirement for a TOLCMP on programs. This TMOP, when developed, should be attached as part of TOLCMP.\n\n3.3.2.4 Technical Manual Content and Product Plan (TMCPP). For S1000D IETM development, the contract should\ninclude the development of a TMCPP as a deliverable within the TMCR. The TMCPP should be delivered in contractor\nformat and specify the end-to-end development and integration of the IETM. The current version of the TMCR provides\ndetailed requirements that should be included within the Contractor\u2019s plan.\n\n3.3.3 Contractor Logistics Supportability/Total System Integration Responsibility (TSIR) Contracts. If the program\nwill be sustained by the contractor for life, the TOMA must engage in writing technical order requirements to de\ufb01ne the role\nof the contractor sustainment responsibility. Since these arrangements require contractors to sustain technical manuals for the\nlife of the program, considerations must be addressed, i.e., the number of changes to be issued annually, a surge capability\n\n3-3\n",

Budgets must also be addressed to ensure the\nPMs include all TO related cost in their Program Objective Memorandum (POM) submittals. Programs identify TO\nsustainment funding through the annual CAFTOP process (Paragraph 3.5.2).\n\n3.4 REQUIREMENTS PLANNING CONFERENCE.\n\n3.4.1 Requirements Conference. The TOMA will call and chair a TO Planning/Requirements Conference (TOP/RC),\nand request support from others as required, for new program starts. TOP/RC membership is the nucleus of the IPT working\na TO program and includes the Lead Commands and MAJCOMs, other AFMC managers and support agencies. The TOP/RC\n\ufb01nalizes the requirements for input to the RFP. As a minimum, the team must include representatives from other AFMC\nactivities, including the FMM when appropriate, the ESs and Joint Services Managers, and the MAJCOM(s) and any other\nsupport agencies (if required). The safety and nuclear surety offices, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and the\nResponsible Test Organization (RTO) should be included on the team. Contractor representatives should be included as soon\nas the contract is issued, with contracting officer concurrence.\n\n3.4.2 TO Planning/Requirements Conference (TOP/RC) Membership Agreements. The TOP/RC, held before the\nprogram data call, brings together the members of the TO IPT to plan the TO program. Membership continuity in subsequent\nconferences and reviews must be maintained whenever possible. Once the program TO requirements is developed, inputs to\nthe RFP are drafted and the TOLCMP is \ufb01nalized.\n\n3.4.3 Purpose. The TOMA will conduct a joint TOP/RC with the TO IPT. The TOP/RC will identify TO program\nrequirements, prepare TO program schedules, determine what source data is required to support TO development, and plan\nfor TO veri\ufb01cation. One critical task often overlooked is to review the TO speci\ufb01cations and standards which will be\nrequired on the program. If this is not done by the TOP/RC, then the TOMA must review the contractor-proposed tailoring\nbefore the contract is issued to ensure Air Force requirements are met.\n\n3.4.3.1 The conference may be accomplished through face-to-face meetings, correspondence, telephone or other electronic\ncommunication. At the completion of the TOP/RC, the TOMA will document all actions and \ufb01nalize the RFP and the\nTOLCMP.\n\n3.4.3.2 When more than one MAJCOM or DoD component is involved, the Lead Command or component, as identi\ufb01ed\nin the Program Management Directive (PMD), should be the primary source of requirements information. Requirements\nfrom other MAJCOMs should also be considered in TO planning efforts. The planning and requirements derived from this\nconference must follow the established Air Force operation, maintenance and logistics support concepts and plans.\n\n3.4.3.3 The IPT should plan for the use of existing TOs and commercial manuals whenever possible, identify required\nnew TO types and speci\ufb01cations, and establish program milestones based on the PMD.\n\n3.4.3.4 The TO IPT shall evaluate all TO program requirements. Any changes in scope or increase in requirements will be\nthoroughly evaluated and documented in the TOLCMP. Consideration should be given to cost versus effectiveness, trade-\noffs, alternatives, the MAJCOM digitization plan, and the AF TO CONOPS. When disagreements cannot be resolved, the\nTOMA will elevate the matter for resolution to the PSM and in turn to the PM.\n\n3.4.4 Existing Data Usability. Maximum use will be made of existing data. Available Technical Manuals (TM) from\nother government departments or agencies will be reviewed to determine adequacy and application to particular programs.\n\n3.4.5 TO Development Planning. Any TOs developed for the government (at government expense) must be developed\nto current AF TMSS or a government-approved NGS IAW this TO. See Section VIII for digital TO and TMSS requirements.\n\n3.4.5.1 Joint Acquisition Programs. For joint-service acquisition programs, TMs should be developed in a single format\nusable by all services involved, rather than developing individual manuals for each service.\n\n3.4.5.2 Delivery Requirements. Delivery of PTOs shall be prior to or concurrent with delivery of the hardware for\ndevelopment testing and/or operational need dates. Formal organizational level (on-equipment) TOs and preliminary inter-\nmediate level (off-equipment) TOs will be delivered prior to or concurrently with the delivery of the \ufb01rst production\ncon\ufb01gured system or commodity to the \ufb01rst operational unit. Intermediate-level manuals must be formalized by the Initial\nOperational Capability (IOC) date.\n\n3-4\n",

Preliminary depot\nlevel TOs will be delivered prior to depot prototype overhaul and must be veri\ufb01ed and formalized prior to depot activation.\n\n3.4.5.2.2 If TOs cannot be delivered according to this policy, the TOMA must revise veri\ufb01cation schedules, update the\nTOLCMP, and recommend interim support for the MAJCOM, use of veri\ufb01ed or partly veri\ufb01ed PTOs, Interim Contractor\nSupport (ICS, AFI 63-111, Contract Support for Systems, Equipment and End-Items, etc.) until the manuals are delivered.\nAny such actions must be coordinated with and approved by the appropriate PM and the MAJCOM/DoD Component.\n\n3.4.5.3 Preliminary Technical Orders (PTOs).\n\n3.4.5.3.1 ETIMS will only manage PTO numbering and indexing. TOMAs establish procedures to manage and control\ndistribution of PTOs prior to formalization and publication as stated in Paragraph 5.2.\n\n3.4.5.3.2 The TOMA requests a TO number for PTOs using the same procedures as in Paragraph 3.9.3.1. AFLCMC/\nLZPTP-TINKER enters the approved number in the ETIMS Review TO Number Request screen. The TOMA receives a\nnoti\ufb01cation on their Home Screen indicating the TO number has been reviewed/approved. The TOMA will use the Manage\nTO Screens to index the PTO, marking Available for Index to Yes so users are able to establish ID.\n\n3.4.5.3.3 PTOs are prepared in limited quantities during TO acquisition to support In-Process Reviews (IPRs), contractor\ncerti\ufb01cation, and government veri\ufb01cation activities. A TO is considered \u2019preliminary\u2019 from the time the publication has a\nnumber assigned until the TO is formalized. PTOs are formalized after they are successfully veri\ufb01ed and all corrections are\nmade and accepted, normally during a pre-pub review. PTOs must complete the contractor quality process before delivery to\nthe government for veri\ufb01cation. Air Force personnel may use unveri\ufb01ed data during system Test and Evaluation (T&E) on\nnew or modi\ufb01ed hardware or software or in the performance of routine maintenance if the intent is to verify the data. Every\neffort shall be made to replace organizational-level PTOs with formal TOs prior to or concurrent with delivery of the \ufb01rst\nproduction-con\ufb01gured system or commodity to the \ufb01rst operational unit. Formatted PTOs should be used to the maximum\nextent possible to support Air Force T&E (AFI 63-101/20-101). PTOs are also normally used for development of formatted\ntraining plans and course syllabuses.\n\n3.4.5.3.4 Verifying and Formalizing PTOs. After the TO has been veri\ufb01ed to the maximum extent possible, the TOMA\ndevelops a TO update to convert the PTO to a formal TO. Prior to distribution of formal TO/eTO update, the TOMA will\nenter the publication date. The Available for Distribution \ufb02ag in the TO index is automatically set to Yes when the content is\nloaded to TODPG (for distributed media) or eTO is deployed (for\u2013WA-1). ETIMS will automatically enter the estimated\ndistribution date (EDD) from TODPG when the AFD is set to Yes. The Available for Distribution \ufb02ag shall be manually set\nto Yes by the TOMA to indicate a -WA-2 is available for distribution. For all media types the Available for Index \ufb02ag must\nbe set to Yes and Publication Stock Number (PSN) created by ETIMS for catalog to be updated.\n\n3.5 DEVELOPING ESTIMATED BUDGET FOR PM TO COVER TO COSTS.\n\n3.5.1 TO Initial Acquisition Budgeting and Cost Estimating. The TOMA is responsible for estimating the cost of TOs\nneeded to support the military system or commodity. The cost of acquiring TOs includes writing, editing, supporting\nconferences and reviews, veri\ufb01cation, preparation of reproducible masters, printing and distribution, routine maintenance,\nand TO-related travel (AFI 65-601V1). TO costs are chargeable to the same budget program activity code used to \ufb01nance\nhardware costs during initial acquisition. The TOMA must begin the cost estimating process shortly after assignment to\nensure adequate program funds are available. All information sources should be explored, including, but not limited to,\nhistorical data from other programs, contractor estimates, and prior experience. The PM must ensure the annual program\nbudget submission includes TO requirements.\n\n3.5.2 Sustainment Funding and Program Brochure Transfer. TOMAs must begin planning for the seamless transfer\nof TO programs from the acquisition phase to sustainment phase as soon as possible after test and evaluation. TOMAs shall\nuse the CAFTOP to plan and schedule compliance with these funding requirements (see Chapter 5 for sustainment CAFTOP\nprocesses). Exemptions and deviations must be authorized by waivers (see Paragraph 1.2.1). PMs/TOMAs will use the\nCAFTOP Working Group SharePoint site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10792/default.aspx) to access the CAFTOP Handbook,\nthe Technical Order Requirements Process. Use CAFTOP Handbook procedures to develop a weapon system/commodity-\nspeci\ufb01c CAFTOP Annex for submission to the appropriate Lead Command (AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and\nResponsibilities for Weapon Systems, in time to support a budget submission for the current Future Years Defense Plan\n(FYDP). AFI 65-601(v1), Section 4E, describes the complete funding requirements for Air Force technical manuals. Funding\nfor physical-distribution digital media (e.g. CD-ROMs or DVDs) is managed the same as funding for individual TOs,\nthrough the CAFTOP process.\n\n3-5\n",

The PM will address all Time Compliance TOs (TCTOs), new Operations and Maintenance\n(O&M) TOs, and O&M TO updates required to support planned modi\ufb01cations in the Technical Order Financial Brochure\n(TOFB) and CAFTOP Annex submitted to the Lead Command for funding. However, TCTO and related new TOs or TO\nupdates are funded by the speci\ufb01c modi\ufb01cation project.\n\nNOTE\n\nSome acquisition program contracts provide for system upgrades as part of the contracted effort. Sustainment\nprograms must use modi\ufb01cation funding for all TCTOs and TCTO-related TO updates, publication and distribu-\ntion.\n\n3.5.3.1 The TOMA ensures funding requirements for TCTO acquisition, veri\ufb01cation, related TO updates, printing and\ndistribution have been considered in modi\ufb01cation funding packages. Requirements include costs to remove before and add\nafter data (before and after modi\ufb01cation) in TOs. (For S1000D/IETM based TOs, refer to Section VIII).\n\n3.5.3.2 The TOMA annotates the fund citation or modi\ufb01cation number in the print package submitted to the Technical\nOrder Distribution Print Gateway (TODPG) (Reference Functional Users Guide (FUG) at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).\nIf the package also contains non-modi\ufb01cation-related changes, the annotation will show the related fund citations and the\npercentage chargeable to each.\n\n3.5.3.3 For Inspection Program (-6 TO) changes that will cause depot maintenance Depot Programmed Equipment Main-\ntenance (DPEM) fund obligations, the responsible Production Management Activity (PMA) (for TCTO modi\ufb01cation kits)\nwill contact the DPEM funds point of contact to ensure adequate funds are available. The PMA will procure and manage the\navailable funds per AFI 65-601V1 and associated AFMC supplements.\n\n3.5.3.4 Spares Replacement. Acquisition funds and the stock fund are used to acquire new TOs or TO updates driven\nby the need to replace existing spare parts and components with new items. The Product Group Manager (PGM) provides\nthe TOMA with a printout of the replacement item cost computation. The TOMA annotates the total dollar requirement for\nthe maintenance of commodity TOs resulting from the acquisition of replacement spare items. The TCM will assist the\nTOMA with computing the impact of spares replenishment on weapon systems TOs based on history and known future\nacquisitions. The TOMA provides budget requirements by weapon system.\n\n3.6 CONTRACTING FOR TECHNICAL ORDERS.\n\nTOs will be acquired IAW DoD 5010.12-M, Procedures for the Acquisition and Management of Technical Data, on a\nseparately priced Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) using a contract exhibit consisting of a DD Form 1423, Contract\nData Requirements List (CDRL), with a program-speci\ufb01c (tailored) TM 86-01, Technical Manual Contract Requirements\n(TMCR) document. The TMCR is managed by HQ AFMC/A4F in coordination with other acquisition agencies. The latest\nversion of the TMCR, located on the AF TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531 must be used for all new\nTO contracts. Programs may submit a waiver through their Center TO Home Office if their current TMCR is adequately\nsupporting the program. TOMA/PM must coordinate on the development of CDRLs and TMCR of new contracting actions\nfor the purchase or sustainment of TOs. The local TO Functional Site Office will provide guidance to TOMAs, FMMs and\nTCMs with TO acquisition, development, review, and veri\ufb01cation of assigned systems. This includes providing support to\nTOMAs and TCMs on the development of new contracting actions and providing local, specialized training IAW AFMCI\n21-301.\n\n3.6.1 Technical Manual Contract Requirements (TMCR) Document, TM 86-01. A TMCR is used in all contracts for\nacquisition, sustainment or modi\ufb01cation of systems and equipment when TOs must be developed or updated. The TMCR is\nincluded in the RFP either as an exhibit, as part of the system performance speci\ufb01cation, or in the Technical Library, and is\nreferenced in Section J. The exhibit will have a separately-priced CLIN in the formal contract (DoD 5010.12-M).\n\nNOTE\n\nTMCR requirements apply equally to contracted TO development efforts and to in-house TO development and\nupdating.\n\n3.6.2 Description. The TMCR Template now consists of two parts: The \ufb01rst for the acquisition of TMSS compliant linear\ntechnical manuals, and the second part for the acquisition of S1000D IETMs. Programs will only need to tailor one of the\nparts for their acquisition activity and delete the unused part. The TMCR consists of three sections; TO Program Require-\nments, TM Type and Delivery Requirements, and Speci\ufb01cation/Standards Interface Records (SIR).

Section 3 contains the SIRs for joint-service TMSS with Air Force tailoring speci\ufb01ed and contains links to\nthe TMSS Tailoring Tool and the S1000D Decision Point Tool. TOMAs will utilize both tools to specify their standard\nTMSS tailoring requirements and/or to specify their S1000D functionality requirements and program business rules. The\noutputs provided from these tools will be attached to Section 3 as contractual SIR requirements. The TOMA is responsible\nto tailor the entire TMCR prior to placing the TMCR in an exhibit to the contract. The Contractor/Offeror may propose and\nsubmit, in writing, additional tailoring to the TOMA and Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) for consideration. If approved,\nthis additional tailoring shall be added to the TMCR as part of the contract deliverable. Programs that have developed a TO\nConcept of Operations (TO CONOPS) may attach the TO CONOPS to the TMCR to aid the contractor in understanding the\nprogram requirements. A published overarching Air Force TO CONOPS is available at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12837/\nafkn_docs/forms/allitems.aspx.\n\n3.6.3 Tailoring. Tailoring serves two purposes; to delete TMCR requirements excess to program needs, and select options\npresented within speci\ufb01cations and standards. Only those TM Type Selection Tables, TM Delivery Requirements Matrices\nand SIRs applicable to a particular contract are left in the TMCR. A TMCR Writing Guide is available on the TOMA\nSharePoint Site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531/default.aspx to assist programs in tailoring their contractual requirements.\nExamples of TMCR tailoring can be found in the TMCR folder on the LZSA SharePoint (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/20955/\nlogistics%20program%20support/default.aspx).\n\nNOTE\n\nUpdates to existing TOs and new TOs for existing programs may be acquired in same style and format when this\nis satisfactory to all affected agencies and is cost effective over the program life cycle. In these cases, list the TOs\naffected in TMCR Table 2. However, if any existing SGML-tagged formats are not TMSS compliant and cannot\nbe viewed on the eTO Viewer (eTOV), revisions and new TOs which will be converted to HTML or XML and\ndistributed as eTOs must be brought into compatibility with the eTOV. If this is not possible (funding limitations,\ncontractual issues, etc.), the PM must obtain approval from the Lead Command and get an AFMC/A4F waiver to\nhost eTOs sites other than the ETIMS repository. For these waived manuals, index the media suffix-WA-2, and list\nthe URL in the TO Details page. If the TOs can be distributed in PDF, no re-writes are required.\n\n3.6.4 DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). The DD 1423 is used to establish a separately priced\nCLIN. It is usually attached with the TMCR in the contract and listed in the Part I, Section B, Supplies or Services and\npricing/cost schedule as well as Part III - List of Documents, Exhibits, and Other Attachments, Section J, List of Attach-\nments. A separate CDRL, identi\ufb01ed as an exhibit to the contract, shall be used in conjunction with the CLIN for TOs. CDRL\nBlock 4, Authority, shall list the Air Force TMCR, TM 86-01, in place of a Data Item Description (DID) or TMSS. The\nTMCR must be tailored to list only the military speci\ufb01cations or standards applicable to the contract. Multiple TO CDRLs\nmay be used to price TOs by work segment, e.g., Organizational level TOs, Depot level TOs, and Operational TOs. The\nrespective TMCRs will be attached to the CDRLs. For convenience, multiple TO CDRLs may be grouped together in one\ncontract exhibit or separate contract exhibits may be established for each CDRL. In either case a separate price for each\nCDRL should be in the exhibit or on the CDRL.\n\n3.6.4.1 Options. There are two options for the use of CDRLs:\n\n3.6.4.1.1 The TOMA may include draft CDRLs for known data requirements in the RFP. The CDRL for TO delivery (if\nincluded), with the TMCR attached, will be referenced in RFP Section J. The Instruction to Offerors will require the offerors\nto develop Statement of Work (SOW) paragraphs, complete CDRL tailoring and submit any other suggested data require-\nment CDRLs with the proposals.\n\n3.6.4.1.2 If CDRLs are not included in the RFP, the Instruction to Offerors will require offerors to propose all data\nrequirements, including TOs. In this case, a partly-tailored TMCR may be placed in either the system speci\ufb01cation or the\nProposal Technical Library.\n\nNOTE\n\nAll DIDs can be found on\n(https://assist.dla.mil/online/start/)\n\n3-7\n",

The SOO should specify TO objectives in performance-based terminology. Evaluation\ncriteria must support the SOO and be traceable to the Instruction to Offerors sections. The SOO is a government-prepared\nattachment to either Section J or L of the RFP. The SOO provides the basic, top-level objectives of the acquisition program.\nAdditionally, program objectives focus on the higher risk areas individually, so each area can be addressed directly in the\nevaluation criteria. These higher risk areas are usually valid discriminators in the source selection process. Areas of relatively\nlow risk are generally covered by higher level objectives. The SOO allows the offeror maximum \ufb02exibility to develop\ncost-effective solutions and to propose innovative alternatives to meet the stated objectives. The SOO also allows the\ngovernment to assess offeror understanding of the effort to be performed, by eliminating the how to instructions typically\nprovided in a SOW, (MIL-HDBK-245, Preparation of Statement of Work (SOW)).\n\n3.7.1.2 Phrasing Objectives. Depending on the level of risk, TO objectives will be addressed in a variety of ways. For\nmost acquisition programs, the TO objective would be covered with a statement such as: Provide quality technical manuals,\nsource data and options for the government to obtain data acquisition rights to support the objective of Air Force organic\nsystem operation and \ufb01eld and depot-level maintenance for the system life cycle. Actual wording will depend on program\noperations and maintenance concepts. Where TOs are considered a low-risk area, TO objectives may be covered by the more\ngeneral logistics support objective.\n\n3.7.2 Work Statement Options.\n\n3.7.2.1 Statement of Work (SOW). A SOW de\ufb01nes, either directly or by reference to other documents, all tasks to be\nperformed for the program covered by the contract. The SOW is limited to what is required - qualitative, quantitative and\nother requirements (how, when and where) will be contained in speci\ufb01cations, the Integrated Master Plan (IMP) and CDRLs\n(MIL-HDBK-245 and DoD 5010.12-M). Use of a SOW in the RFP is usually limited to follow-on or small program\ncontracts, as directed by the PM.\n\n3.7.2.2 Government-Prepared SOWs. For government-prepared SOWs, TO requirements should be limited to perfor-\nmance-based statements, e.g., The contractor shall develop the technical order types speci\ufb01ed in the TMCR (Exhibit) to\nsupport (program name) (CDRL (#)). Additional statements, covering the applicable task areas may either be added to the\nSOW or to the \ufb01rst section of the TMCR as required to fully describe TO program requirements.\n\n3-8\n",

The\nproposal SOW and IMP together should specify the tasks, events and processes the offeror will use to satisfy RFP require-\nments. The Instruction to Offerors must be explicit enough to allow the contractor to tailor a TMCR for submittal with the\nproposal.\n\n3.7.2.4 Performance-Based Work Statements (PWS). A PWS de\ufb01nes the requirements in terms of results rather than\nthe method of performing the work. It cites referenced directives by speci\ufb01c process/procedure (e.g., paragraph or chapter)\nrather than the entire publication. At a minimum, a PWS includes a description of Services/General Information (de\ufb01nitions,\netc.); a Services Summary; a list of Government-Furnished Property and Services, if applicable; and Appendices such as\nworkload estimates, labor hour rates, square footage, etc.\n\n3.7.3 Request for Proposal (RFP).\n\n3.7.3.1 The TOMA will make inputs to the PM data call to ensure that TO-related data is placed on contract. The TOMA\nmust ensure that the proper FAR/DFARS data rights clauses are included in the RFP. These requirements will not be altered\nby the PM or Data Manager without the concurrence of the TOMA, MAJCOM and support agencies. The Instruction to\nOfferors will inform contractors responding to the RFP about information to be included in the proposal. Evaluation Criteria\n(section M of the RFP) must be traceable to both the SOO and Instruction to Offerors. AFI 63-101/20-101 describes the\nprocedures for securing data rights, ensuring technical data is addressed in the RFP and for ensuring costs associated with\ntechnical data are visible and contain supporting documentation.\n\n3.7.3.2 CDRL, TMCR and CLIN. The government shall develop a draft TMCR for the RFP. This TMCR shall be updated\nbased on approved contractor data recommendations for inclusion in the \ufb01nal contract. The TMCR is attached to the CDRL\nfor delivery of TOs. The TMCR shall require a separate CLIN for delivery of Technical Manuals, and shall become a\nseparately-priced exhibit to the contract (DFARS 227.7103-2, Acquisition of Technical Data, and DoD 5010.12-M). The RFP\nmust include a separate CLIN asking for a priced option to obtain unlimited rights to technical data if the Offeror has\nproposed only limited rights. (Paragraph 3.20.2.4.)\n\n3.7.3.3 The TO IPT (Paragraph 3.4.1) develops draft TO program objectives and criteria as inputs for the work statement\nor SOO, Evaluation Criteria and Instruction to Offerors. The drafts are provided to the program contracting office and data\nmanager, along with a partly-tailored TMCR for inclusion in the RFP system performance speci\ufb01cation.\n\n3.7.3.4 If the RFP includes TOs releasable under provisions of AFI 61-201, they may be released directly to prospective\nbidders. If the RFP includes TOs not releasable under provisions of AFI 61-201, they should be made available for review in\na bidder\u2019s library at the buying location. For those TOs which are only distributed as ETIMS electronic TOs (eTOs), the PM\nmay direct the TOMA to upload the eTOs to the eTO viewer. Release of export-controlled technical orders outside of DoD\nrequires completion of a DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.\n\n3.7.4 Instructions to Offerors.\n\n3.7.4.1 The Instructions to Offeror, Section L of the RFP, identi\ufb01es how the offerors must submit proposals and what\nproposals must cover for the government to evaluate the proposal according to the evaluation criteria in Section M. For\nexample, the Instructions to Offeror may require a tailored TMCR, associated SOW tasks, and IMP program event entrance\nand exit criteria. The Instructions to Offeror essentially addresses topics contained in TMCR Section 1. Offerors will be\nrequired to select and tailor applicable TMSS, listed in the TMCR, for the types of TOs required by the program.\n\n3.7.4.2 Proposals. Offerors respond to an RFP with proposals for satisfying Air Force objectives. Proposals are evaluated\nIAW the AF Source Selection Plan.\n\n3.7.4.3 Proposal Contents. Offeror proposals submitted in response to an RFP will include any documents the RFP\nrequires. That will usually include some combination of a work statement, completed (separately priced) TMCR for TOs,\nrecommendations for any other data required, an IMP, and/or an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS -Appendix A) covering\nthe management and control of the acquisition program. Offeror responses indicate how the contractor intends to satisfy RFP\nrequirements.\n\n3.7.4.3.1 Request for Proposal Quality Assurance Provisions. The Instructions to Offeror may require the offeror to\ninclude details of the contractor QA process in their proposal, if the process has not been previously documented and\nsupported by applicable past performance data or if there is exceptional risk in the program. The process will be evaluated\nfor conformance to accepted commercial standards, such as the ISO 9000 series. The TOMA will obtain insight into process\n\n3-9\n",

Digital data deliveries are inspected and accepted on several levels: 1) physical\nmedia, 2) data exchange formats and, 3) data content and format. Contractors must demonstrate the online access service as\nthe basis for government acceptance. TOs delivered pursuant to the contract must meet the requirements of this chapter and\nthe contractor\u2019s tailored TMCR. The quality of proposed commercial manuals will be evaluated according to MIL-PRF-\n32216, Evaluation of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Manual and Preparation of Supplemental Data.\n\n3.8 SOURCE SELECTION PROCESS.\n\nDuring source selection the government will review and clarify any issues with the TMCR and RFP. Source Selection rules\ndetermine how the government will ask questions and negotiate unresolved issues. On-site visits to contractors may be\nrequired. The \ufb01nal evaluation results are presented to a Source Selection Authority to determine which offeror best satis\ufb01es\nthe RFP. That offeror is subsequently awarded the contract. Once contracts are awarded, the provisions may only be changed\nthrough the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).\n\n3.8.1 Proposal Evaluation Criteria. The following provides guidance for TOMA evaluation of TO acquisition or sustain-\nment contract cost and delivery proposals, and participation in subsequent negotiations with the offeror, under the direction\nof the PCO. The TOMA should be knowledgeable in all relevant areas of TO acquisition or sustainment, and must thor-\noughly understand program requirements, the RFP, and the evaluation criteria. Assistance and comments should be solicited\nfrom appropriate PM or staff agency personnel if some parts of the proposal are beyond TOMA expertise and experience.\nDuring competitive contract bidding, the TOMA must not contact any bidder directly. There must be no bias or any\nappearance of con\ufb02ict of interest.\n\n3.8.1.1 Evaluation Criteria. Evaluation criteria, Section M of the RFP, will be developed based upon the SOO and will\ndrive development of the Instruction to Offerors (Section L of the RFP). TO inputs will be prepared by the TOMA to support\nand establish standards for evaluation of an offeror response to the RFP. Section M informs offerors how the government will\nevaluate and rank proposals. For TOs, a primary criterion is development IAW Air Force TMSS to ensure ETIMS compat-\nibility. Other criteria include complete program coverage, acceptable in-house processes to ensure delivery of technically\naccurate documents and data, past performance and support of government veri\ufb01cation.\n\n3.8.1.2 Developing Evaluation Criteria and Checklists. Documented criteria must be developed from program require-\nments prior to RFP release. These evaluation criteria (or a checklist), must be used to analyze any proposals. The criteria\nshould list the requirements in rank order and establish the minimum acceptable level of compliance for a proposal to be\nconsidered acceptable, consistent with the evaluation factors. The criteria may be either quantitative or qualitative depending\nupon the factors or sub-factors addressed. The criteria will allow all proposals submitted against an RFP to be evaluated to\nthe same standards and help to prevent any charges of bias or unfair practices. The TOMA, in conjunction with the IPT, will\ndevelop TO program evaluation criteria.\n\n3.8.2 Technical Evaluation. The purpose of the TO technical evaluation is to determine whether offeror proposals meet\nthe requirements of the RFP, and offeror-proposed hours allocated for TO development are realistic, complete, fair and\nreasonable in relationship to the RFP. The evaluation should assess offeror understanding of and ability to comply with\nprogram requirements based on the proposal, Contractor Performance Assessment Reports (CPAR, available from the PCO)\nor site surveys, interviews, etc. The quality of the contractor processes and ability to provide an acceptable product are\nprimary concerns. The principal TOMA role is to evaluate the technical merit of the TO portion of the proposal.\n\n3.8.2.1 TOMA Role. The TOMAs primary role is to evaluate proposal compliance with an understanding of RFP provi-\nsions and the adequacy and accuracy of individual elements relating to technical data development.\n\n3.8.2.2 Assess whether the proposal is realistic or not by comparing offeror proposed efforts with similar contracts on\nother programs, both by the same offeror and by other contractors of similar size and capabilities.\n\n3.8.2.3 For page-oriented TOs, consider such elements as hours per page (new and changed), number of pages (new and\nchanged), types of pages (text, illustration, and mixed), travel costs (location, duration, number of people), and hours for\nTO-related plans and reports.\n\n3.8.2.4 For IETM/S1000D based TOs, evaluation elements will depend on the offeror units of measurement. Some ele-\nments included could be number and complexity of tasks, lines of software code, number, format and complexity of\nillustrations, etc. (Section VIII.) Because proposals associated with IETM technical data development include a Common\nSource Database (CSDB) management component, a CSDB expert should be assigned to the source selection team.

All pre-S1000D Type\nII IETMs that capitalize off data reuse fall under this requirement if they are organically sustained by the AF.\n\n3.8.2.5 If the offeror based proposal costs for some elements on historical data, the TOMA should evaluate the validity of\nthe data used; i.e., Is this effort similar to the baseline used for the calculations? Is the baseline recent? Are the calculations\nstatistically accurate? Has any upgrade to offeror production equipment been considered, etc?\n\n3.8.2.6 When comparing hours with those proposed by other contractors, the TOMA must make allowances for different\nmethods of documenting and allocating labor and hours. The TOMA may want to consult with other PM or staff experts in\nthis area.\n\n3.8.2.7 There are two components of completeness; complete justi\ufb01cation of costs and complete coverage of require-\nments. Costs in this instance are primarily labor hours, with the addition of travel, reproduction, and similar dollar costs.\n\n3.8.2.8 The coverage of offeror proposed efforts must be assessed by comparing the proposal with the RFP scope and\neffort. Of critical importance are the data rights proposed. Data rights should support future changes in support and\noperating concepts. If the program is totally funded by the government, the TOMA should propose unlimited rights to all\ntechnical data developed for the program. During this portion of the evaluation, the TOMA may discover that the RFP is\nmisleading or incomplete or unneeded requirements have been included. In this case, the TOMA must notify the PCO so that\nofferors have the opportunity to modify proposals.\n\n3.8.2.9 The TOMA should provide the PCO with an estimate of contract risk (high or low), based on the scope, period,\nand technical requirements of the RFP. Higher risk technologies would justify higher percentage pro\ufb01ts. For example, is the\noverall program established or leading edge technology? What percentage is new development versus modi\ufb01cation or\noff-the-shelf? How long is the contract period? Are the TOs traditional page-based formats or IETM/S1000D based TOs?\n\n3.8.2.10 Offeror ability to comply with program requirements may be assessed by comparing the offeror proposal with the\nevaluation factors and criteria (did the proposal indicate a complete understanding of the effort involved?) by reviewing\nCPARs of past performance on similar contracts, by site visits, interviews, and other investigation methods.\n\n3.8.2.11 Reporting the evaluation results is critical. The TOMA must indicate which portion of each proposal is being\nevaluated, whether that portion meets the requirements documented in the RFP, whether the RFP has any internal problems,\nwhat must be done to correct any shortfalls, and a risk assessment of offeror ability to perform. Accuracy, brevity and clarity\nare the keys to successfully preparing an evaluation report.\n\n3.8.2.12 During evaluation some aspects or provisions of the proposal may appear de\ufb01cient or require clari\ufb01cation. If data\nprovided in the proposal fails to address all contract requirements, is inadequate for a proper evaluation or is contradictory,\nan Evaluation Notice (EN) should be submitted through the PCO. ENs must be speci\ufb01c and limited to the aspect of the\nofferor proposal causing the problem.\n\n3.8.3 Contractor Costs. Cost for TO development fall into two categories, direct and indirect. Direct refers to those costs\nincurred solely as a result of the TO development effort, such as writing, editing, printing, and so forth. Indirect refers to\ncosts which would be incurred whether or not TOs were developed, such as company management, facility operation.\n\n3.8.4 Speci\ufb01c Technical Order Proposal Evaluation Guidelines.\n\n3.8.4.1 Areas Subject to Double Charging. Not all TOs or source data packages require all support functions, and the\nofferor proposal should clearly differentiate these items. For example, some commercial manuals do not require supplement-\ning, and the only allowable costs should be for development of an Identifying Technical Publication Sheet (ITPS), purchase\nof multiple copies, and administrative processing of the CFE Notices and manual certi\ufb01cation. If task development is\nperformed as part of a Supportability Analysis (when on contract), TOs should not also be charged for task development.\n\n3.8.4.2 TO Sizes. The TOMA should estimate page counts (and/or \ufb01le lengths, database sizes, etc. for digital TOs) by\ncomparing the program to existing programs for similar military systems or commodities when possible. For example, is the\nofferor proposed number of pages in line with this estimation? If TOs are priced individually or by types, compare the\nnumber of pages proposed with the number of pages in published TOs of the same type for similar equipment.\n\n3-11\n",

If historical data from like systems is not available, the TOMA should solicit inputs from the PM\ntechnical services function.\n\n3.8.4.4 Technical Order Data Rights. The TOMA should assess any areas of the proposal where the Offeror has\nproposed less than full rights to the technical data. The key concern is whether the government will have adequate rights to\nsupport the weapon system for its life cycle, including data for alternate repair source selection and competitive spare parts\nprocurement. The TMCR may require a separately priced option that provides for the government\u2019s rights to a future\ndelivery of the technical data.\n\n3.8.4.5 Evaluation Assistance. TOMA evaluations should be based on experience and judgment to the maximum extent\npossible, using the resources of other TOMAs and the TO IPT. When necessary, ask the offerors speci\ufb01c questions regarding\ntheir proposals, through the PCO.\n\n3.8.5 Protecting Evaluation and Contract Award. The effectiveness and integrity of the contracting process requires\nthat all data and information be handled with the utmost discretion to avoid any compromise. All data and information\nreceived or developed during proposal evaluation shall be protected from unauthorized disclosure IAW the FAR and DoDM\n5400.07.\n\n3.8.6 Proposal Evaluation and Contract Award. During source selection, contractor proposals will be evaluated using\nRFP section M criteria, and will be ranked according to several factors (including such things as past performance, demon-\nstrated understanding of requirements, and price.) A contract is negotiated and awarded to the winning offeror.\n\n3.8.7 Identi\ufb01cation of Additional Technical Manual Requirements (Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) Evalua-\ntion). Evaluate ECPs, associated TCTOs, and Contract Change Proposals (CCPs) against the baseline contract to ensure\ncosts correspond to the original proposal and were not included in the baseline costs. Some TO updates as a result of ECPs\nshould be included in the routine periodic update program, and some proposed additions to the number of TOs developed or\nacquired may be included in contract baselines. Evaluate the ECPs/CCPs against similar items previously submitted by the\ncontractor.\n\n3.9 TO DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.\n\n3.9.1 General Guidelines. The TO development process is managed by the TOMA within the framework of a TO\nprogram. The conferences, reviews and veri\ufb01cation activities conducted by the TOMA are an essential and formal process\nhelping to ensure the data developed meets the needs of the users within the program scope. Attendance at these TO\ndevelopment activities must be limited to the minimum number of personnel required to accomplish the purpose of the\nconference or review. Personal preference must not affect requirements. After the program contract is signed, any modi\ufb01ca-\ntions to requirements noted during these conferences and reviews must be documented for PCO action. Minutes of proceed-\nings are not authorization to change contracts.\n\n3.9.1.1 Involvement. The TOMA shall be involved in all aspects of the acquisition program, as there are very few areas\nthat will not affect TO and source data development. The TOMA should participate in such non-TO program meetings as\nlogistics and program management reviews, supportability and provisioning conferences, Preliminary and Critical Design\nReviews (PDR and CDR), and Support Equipment Recommendation Data (SERD) Reviews.\n\n3.9.1.2 Preparation. The TOMA shall be prepared to discuss TO issues at logistics and program management reviews. In\naddition, the TOMA will assess and coordinate changes to schedules and availability of equipment to support future TO\nevents.\n\n3.9.1.3 Participation. In addition to agencies listed above, participation should include local Defense Contract Manage-\nment Agency (DCMA) personnel. Air Force attendees should be officers and/or E6-E9 enlisted personnel or civilian equiva-\nlents. AF attendees should be familiar with Air Force and MAJCOM TO acquisition and system support policies. All\nparticipants should understand applicable TMSS, publications, functions, and contract requirements. Conference members\nmust have the authority to make rapid, objective and logical decisions based on contract requirements and Air Force and\nMAJCOM policies.\n\n3.9.2 Initial Technical Order Guidance Conference. The IPT, with the contractor included, will hold an Initial TO\nGuidance Conference where program plans are reviewed and approved, and schedules are established. The timing is usually\nwithin 60 days after contract award to avoid delaying contractor tasks. The contractor can initiate TO preparation after the\nTO guidance conference. This conference is the most critical because it establishes a \ufb01rm understanding between the AF and\n\n3-12\n",

Most new technical order programs can avoid long term problems by\nsuccessfully completing an Initial TO Guidance Conference and ensuring both the AF and the contractor fully understand the\nTO requirements and the expectations of each party. The results of the conference will be fully documented by contractor\nminutes, and coordinated with IPT members. The TOMA will approve and publish the minutes and summarize conference\n\ufb01ndings and action items.\n\n3.9.2.1 The TO Guidance Conference is co-chaired by the TOMA and contractor to ensure understanding of the contract\nrequirements. The TOMA briefs on the purpose, objectives, scope and functions of the conference and clari\ufb01es requirements,\nplans, and schedules. At this time the TOMA may provide the TOLCMP to the contractor. Speci\ufb01c agenda items should\ninclude a review of the contract to ensure mutual understanding of the requirements; a review of applicable speci\ufb01cations\nand established Air Force TO policy; a review of basic planning data to ensure mutual understanding of the program and\nintended users requirements; and establishment of contacts to provide subsequent guidance and information.\n\n3.9.2.2 Requirements that were not fully de\ufb01ned or could not be de\ufb01ned until hardware selection and applicable operation\nand maintenance concepts had been analyzed will be \ufb01nalized during the TO Guidance Conference.

Guidance Conference objectives are to clarify TO tasks and planning data resulting from contract and\nprogram requirements. Participants will review the military system or commodity support plan, Air Force operation and\nmaintenance concepts, Air Force TO policy and intended user capabilities, needs or environment. When required, the TOMA\nwill provide speci\ufb01cation interpretation and comments on contractor plans and schedules presented as part of the proposal.\nSpeci\ufb01c agenda items should be coordinated well before the conference to ensure maximum utility and productivity.\n\n3.9.3 Technical Order Numbering.\n\n3.9.3.1 It is the responsibility of the TOMA to request and assign TO numbers early in the TO acquisition program.\nTOMAs are responsible for requesting numbers for assigned TOs, using the ETIMS Request TO Number screen and the\nguidance in TO 00-5-18. As Preliminary TOs are developed, the TOMA shall index them in ETIMS so prospective users can\nbegin establishing subscriptions. This includes IETM/S1000D based TOs. For each new TO category, the TOMA will\nestablish a TCTO Series Header and electronic TCTO (eTCTO) Series Header for the program\u2019s TOs. Whenever a paper\nTCTO series header is requested and created, a corresponding electronic TCTO (eTCTO) series header should be requested\nand created.\n\nNOTE\n\n\u2022 TO Numbering Functional Users Guides are located on the Air Force Technical Order Manager SharePoint site\nat https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. Information required to establish new or update TO Numbers is contained\nin the Functional Users Guides.\n\n\u2022 Refer to Figure 3-1 for TO Numbering and Indexing Flow Chart.\n\n\u2022 EOD TOs are not numbered and indexed in ETIMS (Reference Chapter 7 and 00-5-18).\n\n\u2022 Only select, Nuclear Weapon Center TOs are currently indexed in ETIMS.\n\n3.9.3.2 TOMAs will develop TO titles IAW FUG https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. An accurate title is an essential\nelement in determining the correct TO number.\n\n3.9.3.3 All media TO numbers being requested will be completed in ETIMS Request TO Number screen using the\nnumbering criteria IAW TO 00-5-18 and approved by AFLCMC/LZPTP-TINKER. TO numbering requests have mandatory\nentries; Proponent; Publication Type; TO Number; Title; TO Manager; Prime System Application; Functional System; and\nFSC. All requests for publication of new TOs in Category 00 must be coordinated with HQ AFMC/A4F by AFLCMC/\nLZPTP-TINKER. See Paragraph 3.9.3.6, Paragraph 3.9.3.7 and Paragraph 3.9.3.8 for numbering procedures with AFMET-\nCAL, NWC and EOD TOs.\n\n3.9.3.4 Once the USAF TO Numbering Specialist reviews and approves the requested TO number, the TOMA shall enter\nadditional information about the TO into the newly established ETIMS Catalog record for the TO.\n\n3-13\n",

Since the ETIMS system starts all TCTO numbers at 501, the \ufb01rst of a series will\nalways start with that number and continue. If a TOMA has an established paper series header and establishes a new,\nmatching electronic series header, when the next TCTO/eTCTO is added, the numbers will not match.

All eTCTOs will be correct from that point forward.\n\n3.9.3.10 AFNWC/NI is responsible for requesting TCTO numbering outside of ETIMS through AFLCMC/LZPTP-TIN-\nKER.\n\n3.9.3.11 TO/TCTO Indexing. When a new TO number is approved or a TO update is generated, the TOMA will:\n\n3.9.3.11.1 Complete ETIMS Index information on new TO number. Improper or incomplete index data will prevent\nviewing TO index data in the TO Catalog, subscribing to or requisitioning the TO using ETIMS. Ensure the TO Record is\nreferenced to the weapon system Mission Design Series (MDS) (if applicable) and equipment part numbers. See ETIMS\nIndexing FUG on AF TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. Additional policy-mandated entries in-\nclude the document classi\ufb01cation, assigned Distribution Statement codes and primary Reason codes.\n\n3.9.3.11.2 If the weapon system is not listed, use the Open Weapon System Chooser in the Manage Tech Order Detail\nscreen to add weapon system. If the weapon system does not already exist, a Field Support Center ticket must be submitted\nto add a new weapon system. AF TOFST shall provide the new weapon system name to AFLCMC/WFNB after adding. If\nthe equipment and/or part number is not listed, use the Maintain Equipment List process to enter data about a new equipment\nitem.\n\n3.9.3.11.3 Anytime a TO is updated to cover additional equipment, the ITIES information must be updated with the\ncomplete new part number. See FUG https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. The data is used to set up and change the TO\nnumber to equipment number cross-reference data in the ETIMS Catalog.\n\n3.9.3.11.4 Do NOT enter JUST the weapons system MDS (e.g. F100 or B2) for TOs covering component assemblies or\nSupport Equipment (SE) for the end item. Use the component/SE part numbers from the TO title.\n\n3.9.3.11.5 For General and MPTOs which do not cover speci\ufb01c weapon systems or equipment, use N/A in both the\nWeapon System Chooser and Maintain Equipment List processes.\n\n3.9.3.11.6 Issue unclassi\ufb01ed updates to classi\ufb01ed TOs whenever possible. When indexing unclassi\ufb01ed updates to a clas-\nsi\ufb01ed TO, TOMA must \ufb01rst index the updates in ETIMS, which will assign the parent TO classi\ufb01cation to the update. Then\nthe TOMA must change the classi\ufb01cation of the unclassi\ufb01ed update only to unclassi\ufb01ed.\n\n3-14\n",

During TO preparation, the IPT conducts In-Process Reviews (IPRs) to\nevaluate progress and compliance with contractual requirements. TO format and content requirements are imposed by the\ncontract. Safety and health reviews will be included in IPRs. The contractor will apply quality management principles to\nensure TO adequacy and accuracy during the development process. See Table 3-1.\n\n3.9.4.1 Scheduling and Purpose. The contractor will recommend the frequency and percentage of IPRs needed for TO\ndevelopment insight. IPRs are an essential part of the TO QA process. IPRs are scheduled by the contractor in coordination\nwith the TOMA and are conducted by the TO IPT. IPRs ensure compatibility with engineering source materials, accuracy of\ndescriptive data, and that TO content, style and format are IAW applicable speci\ufb01cations and other contractual requirements.\nIn addition, IPRs are an opportunity for the IPT to identify issues concerning depth of coverage, missing data, data that\nneeds ampli\ufb01cation, etc., and for coordination and approval procedures for updates.\n\n3.9.4.2 As a general rule, IPRs should be accomplished when the TOs are 30-40 percent and 70-80 percent complete. See\nTable 3-1. Sample In-Process Review completion guides are provided to determine TO completion percentages. In some\ncases (e.g., nuclear weapons TOs, certain critical procedures, etc.), a 100 percent IPR may be required. If initial IPRs\nindicate that the contractor understands the requirements and is producing a quality product, the contract may be modi\ufb01ed to\nreduce the numbers of additional IPRs. For IETM/S1000D based TOs the data will be reviewed online and shall be\nconducted through use of the viewing system selected to support the IETM/S1000D based TOs. Comments and corrections\nwill be captured and recorded electronically. The speci\ufb01c IETM/S1000D IPR methods and procedures shall be documented\nin the TOLCMP.\n\n3.9.4.3 Focus and Support. For earlier IPRs, the primary focus should be on style, format, and planned depth of\ncoverage. Air Force attendees should be officers and/or E6-E9 enlisted personnel or civilian equivalent, with knowledge of\nTO style and format requirements, parent organization policies, and organization signature authority. For later IPRs, the\nfocus shifts to the technical content and comprehensibility of the manual, and personnel should also include technicians of\nthe lowest skill level (5-level minimum) expected to operate or maintain the commodity in the \ufb01eld.\n\n3.9.4.4 If during the IPR the manual being reviewed does not meet the criteria for completion, the manual may be\nrejected. If the manual is rejected, the reasons for rejection must be documented in the meeting minutes along with the\ncorrective actions required. Once the corrective actions have been completed, the contractor shall notify the TOMA that the\ncorrections have been completed or adjudicated. The TOMA will determine if another full IPR is required with the IPT or\nmay determine that the corrections are adequate to move the manual on to the next milestone. These procedures and\nprocesses shall be covered in the TOLCMP.\n\n3.9.5 Contractor Certi\ufb01cation Process. The contractor certi\ufb01cation process will be detailed in the proposal submitted in\nresponse to the RFP. The proposed process may be modi\ufb01ed if necessary during contract negotiations, and when approved,\nbecomes part of the \ufb01nal contract. The decision to place the process on contract is made by the government IPT based on\nassessed risk, including contractor past performance and existing TO certi\ufb01cation procedures. Approved certi\ufb01cation require-\nments must also be applied to any products or processes supplied by vendors or subcontractors. The contractor certi\ufb01cation\nprocess shall also be attached to the TOLCMP, if available.\n\nNOTE\n\nProcedures and source data developed organically by the Air Force do not require certi\ufb01cation, but must be\nveri\ufb01ed prior to incorporation into a TO.\n\n3.9.5.1 Certi\ufb01cation Requirements. The contractor is responsible for the end result of the TO development process; that\nis, for delivery of adequate, safe, current and accurate TOs which conform to government requirements. The data must be\nfully compatible in depth and scope with the established maintenance concept and the approved logistics support plan. The\ndata must be checked for security classi\ufb01cation, distribution restrictions, and Reading Grade Level (RGL). The contractor\nmight use any or all of the previously mentioned procedures as part of their TO certi\ufb01cation management process. These\nrequirements also apply to sustainment contracts.\n\n3.9.5.2 Performance Certi\ufb01cation. When the proposed certi\ufb01cation process includes task performance, the following\nguidance will be followed:\n\n3.9.5.2.1 Nondestructive malfunctions may be introduced for the purpose of checking procedural and fault isolation tasks\nor systems tests. Procedures which could cause damage to the hardware or injury to personnel should be simulated.\n\n3-15\n",

The TOMA will be consulted if\nsubstitution of support equipment is required. The contractor must identify and request any Government Furnished Equip-\nment (GFE) required to support the TO development effort. The TOMA will coordinate with applicable PMs, if necessary, to\nprovide GFE and ensure the equipment will be available to support the weapon system or commodity in the operational\nenvironment.\n\n3.9.5.2.3 Locally fabricated tools or test equipment listed in the TO should be used during testing. Procedures for fabri-\ncating these items shall be included in the TOs.\n\n3.9.5.2.4 Tasks will normally be performed at the contractor facility during system or commodity development testing. If\nrequired GFE is not available, tasks may be performed at an operational or test site when approved by the procurement/\nsustainment managing activity. The contractor will coordinate requirements with any affected agencies.\n\n3.9.5.2.5 When the contractor cannot perform some tasks due to non-availability of GFE resources, the TOMA shall be\nnoti\ufb01ed. The TOMA may provide the required resources (if available) to the contractor or suggest use of a \ufb01eld location. In\nsome cases, combining contractor certi\ufb01cation with AF veri\ufb01cation may be authorized. As a last resort, the TOMA may\nauthorize use of simulation or desktop analysis of the procedures.\n\n3.9.5.2.6 Task performance or simulation may be unnecessary for existing manuals and source data that is applicable to\nthe current con\ufb01guration of the equipment, if a desktop analysis or publication review proves the manuals are current,\nadequate, accurate, and conform to contract requirements.\n\n3.9.5.2.7 QA requirements for Category 11N nuclear weapons TOs are in TO 11N-1-1, Joint Nuclear Weapons Publica-\ntion System Operating Procedures, Speci\ufb01cations and Standards . EOD source data procedures only require contractor\ndesktop analysis; the government will perform any procedures requiring veri\ufb01cation.\n\n3.9.6 Veri\ufb01cation. Veri\ufb01cation is the formal process by which Air Force personnel evaluate and prove TOs and TO\nupdates during acquisition and sustainment are accurate, adequate, safe, and usable in the operational environment to support\nthe program. Current Air Force policy requires that all tasks in TOs and TO updates be 100 percent veri\ufb01ed and that all new\nand updated technical data will be veri\ufb01ed unless waived by the PM IAW AFI 63-101 and this TO. This includes data that\nhas been formalized and is in the sustainment phase of the TO life cycle. Technical data for Contractor Logistics Support\nprograms need not be veri\ufb01ed unless the data will be used by government personnel.\n\n3.9.6.1 Scheduling. The TOMA will work with the MAJCOM to develop a veri\ufb01cation schedule that accounts for the\noverall availability of trained technicians and production con\ufb01gured assets to conduct veri\ufb01cation. Furthermore, veri\ufb01cations\nshould be completed in sufficient time to permit correction, publication, and distribution of formal TOs to \ufb01eld operations\nprior to or concurrent with delivery of the hardware and software to support Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E). When\nthis is not possible, with command approval, use Interim Contractor Support or authorize use of partially-veri\ufb01ed PTOs until\nveri\ufb01cation can be completed (Reference Paragraph 3.9.6.2). Additionally, the TOMA shall ensure the TOLCMP re\ufb02ects the\nlatest TO veri\ufb01cation schedule.\n\n3.9.6.2 Use of PTOs. The TOMA, with approval from the PM in coordination with the Lead Command or Depot, may\nissue a waiver to distribute PTOs to operational units or depot repair facilities for veri\ufb01cation using production equip-\nment. The use of preliminary data shall not exceed 180 days unless readdressed.\n\n3.9.6.3 Partly-Veri\ufb01ed TOs. The inability to verify certain speci\ufb01c maintenance procedures, such as aircraft wing or\nmissile canister removal and replacement should not delay formalization and distribution of TOs. If a partly-veri\ufb01ed TO is\nissued, the TO will include a Veri\ufb01cation Status Page (VSP) or screen, and the \ufb01rst \ufb01eld unit or depot facility required to use\nan unveri\ufb01ed procedure will perform using command veri\ufb01cation IAW TO 00-5-1. Other reasons for issuing partly veri\ufb01ed\nTOs include lack of equipment or other required support to perform veri\ufb01cation. When the destructive nature of the\nprocedures prevents veri\ufb01cation by performance, use simulation or desktop analysis IAW Paragraph 3.9.7.2 or Paragraph\n3.9.7.3.\n\n3.9.6.4 TO Life Cycle Veri\ufb01cation Plan (TOLCVP). Veri\ufb01cation is accomplished IAW the TOLCVP using PTOs pro-\nvided by the contractor. The TOMA is responsible for keeping the TOLCVP updated and coordinated throughout the\nprogram life cycle.

Veri\ufb01cation activities will not be halted due to lack of attendance by other support agency\npersonnel.\n\n3.9.6.6 Contractor Support. Contractor support for the veri\ufb01cation effort should be part of every contract for the acqui-\nsition and/or sustainment of TOs. The support usually consists of a writer and/or engineer. This support is required to\nminimize delays caused by faulty procedures, lack of spare parts, etc.\n\n3.9.6.7 Veri\ufb01cation Waivers. The TOMA, with approval of the PM, may waive veri\ufb01cation by performance/simulation\nwhen procedures are similar to other, previously-veri\ufb01ed procedures on like equipment. The waiver will be documented on\nthe AFTO Form 27, Preliminary Technical Order (PTO) Publication Change Request (PCR)/TO Veri\ufb01cation Record/Ap-\nproval, or on the form creating a TO update. Veri\ufb01cation of minor updates to previously-veri\ufb01ed procedures may be\naccomplished by simulation or Desk-Top Analysis, whichever the TOMA and TCM deem more appropriate, without a\nwaiver.\n\n3.9.6.8 Use of Substitute Items. The TOMA or Veri\ufb01cation Team Manager (VTM) may authorize the use of substitute\nequipment, facilities, or draft procedures. This authorization may be given when the required items are not available and\nthere will be no appreciable difference in procedures. Any such substitution must be coordinated and documented on the\nAFTO Form 27, the form creating a TO update or in the veri\ufb01cation minutes.\n\n3.9.6.9 MAJCOM Responsibilities. Both the technicians for the veri\ufb01cation team and the site for veri\ufb01cation are nor-\nmally provided by the MAJCOM. The selection of quali\ufb01ed MAJCOM personnel to perform veri\ufb01cation depends on the\ntype and level of maintenance established for the military system or commodity being covered. Different teams and veri\ufb01-\ncation locations may be required to cover all maintenance types and levels (on- or off-equipment, \ufb01eld or depot) for TO\nveri\ufb01cation. The veri\ufb01cation team will normally consist of the VTM, technicians, QA and Safety personnel, other support\nagency personnel, and the contractor. The technicians should include the lowest grade and skill level (5-level minimum)\nprojected for day-to-day use of the TO. The MAJCOM may use support contractors as part of the government team.\n\n3.9.6.10 Prioritization. The veri\ufb01cation schedule must be prioritized based on critical operational and maintenance tasks\nthat affect safety, operational readiness and supportability of the system and commodity during initial deployment. Person-\nnel, hardware, consumables and support equipment will be scheduled to ensure availability for each veri\ufb01cation effort.\n\n3.9.6.10.1 First priority for veri\ufb01cation is organizational-level operation and maintenance procedures. Within this group-\ning, procedures are further prioritized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Pilots and/or Operators Manuals\n\n\u2022 All Safety of Flight and Operations procedures\n\n\u2022 All Critical Safety precautions\n\n\u2022 All TOs required for Nuclear and/or Flight Certi\ufb01cation\n\n\u2022 Day-to-day maintenance and operational tasks in O&M TOs and checklists\n\n\u2022 All newly-developed Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) TOs used in support of the above TOs and procedures\n\n\u2022 All remaining TOs and procedures\n\n3.9.6.10.2 Second priority is intermediate and depot level maintenance procedures. Depot TO veri\ufb01cation should be\nperformed in conjunction with depot prototype overhaul certi\ufb01cation to the maximum extent possible. This will ensure that\ntest equipment, software and TOs are compatible, and will reduce the overall cost of the program.\n\n3.9.6.10.3 New and updated non-procedural data veri\ufb01cation will also be prioritized, as listed below. The PM, SCM or\ndesignee may waive veri\ufb01cation of non-procedural data based on priority and risk - the waiver will be documented on an\nAFTO Form 27 or the document generating an update.\n\n\u2022 Safety-related items (Warnings, Cautions, protective gear, etc.)\n\n3-17\n",

Contractor certi\ufb01cation and Air Force veri\ufb01cation pro-\ncesses may be combined when the following conditions exist and the option is approved by the PM and MAJCOM:\n\n3.9.6.11.1 Formally resolve the question of liability for damage to equipment or injury to personnel between the contrac-\ntor and the government before joint performance of procedures. The contractor is responsible for any damages or injuries\ncaused by following faulty procedures. Establish a negotiation process to resolve and document any disputes over liability\nduring the combined effort (request assistance from the Contract Law Office if necessary).\n\n3.9.6.11.2 Tasks should be reviewed for the complexity and hazardous nature of the procedures. Highly complex or\nhazardous procedures should be certi\ufb01ed by the contractor prior to delivery for veri\ufb01cation. Each case must be evaluated and\nagreed upon by the PM and MAJCOM.\n\n3.9.6.11.3 MAJCOM personnel will perform the TO procedures with the guidance and assistance of contractor techni-\ncians.\n\n3.9.6.11.4 The procedures must be in \ufb01nal deliverable format.\n\n3.9.6.12 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technical Orders. Category 60 Joint Service EOD publications for U.S. non-\nnuclear and foreign explosive ordnance are developed by the NSWC IHEODTD. EOD publications will be accepted as valid\nfor Air Force use upon completion of veri\ufb01cation and publishing on the Joint EOD Portal and in JEOD MFK software\n(indicating acceptance by the Military Technical Acceptance Board). AFCEC/CXE manages Air Force participation in the\nveri\ufb01cation program for EOD publications.\n\n3.9.6.13 Nuclear Weapons TOs. Any TO issued under JNWPS will be veri\ufb01ed IAW TO 11N-1-1. The appropriate TCM\nfrom the AF Nuclear Weapons Center, (AFNWC Paragraph 2.8), must participate in the veri\ufb01cation.\n\n3.9.6.14 Nonnuclear Munitions and Explosives TOs. The USAF GACP (Paragraph 2.6.3) must participate in veri\ufb01ca-\ntion of procedures involving nonnuclear munitions and explosives components. The USAF GACP ASC must participate in\nveri\ufb01cation of air superiority missile system TOs (except AGM-65 Maverick, which falls under the GACP).\n\n3.9.6.15 Exemptions. COTS publications and those O&M TOs and source data speci\ufb01cally approved by the TOMA are\nexempt from veri\ufb01cation by performance. TOs for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) are exempt from AF veri\ufb01cation.\n\n3.9.6.16 Calibration Technical Orders. Veri\ufb01cation of 33K TOs will be performed by assigned \ufb01eld-level Precision\nMeasurement Equipment Laboratories (PMEL) within 45 days after receiving the commercial manual or PTO, as directed by\nAFMETCAL.\n\n3.9.6.17 Minor Sustainment Updates. Veri\ufb01cation of minor sustainment updates, including minor changes to procedural\ndata, may use the simpli\ufb01ed Using Command Veri\ufb01cation procedures in TO 00-5-1.

Veri\ufb01cation can take any one or a combination of three acceptable methodologies for accom-\nplishment, depending on the type of equipment or instructions being veri\ufb01ed.\n\n3.9.7.1 Performance. Actual performance on production-con\ufb01gured hardware or government-approved inert versions\n(for explosive items) is the only acceptable means to verify certain tasks. Tasks to be veri\ufb01ed by performance include, but\nare not limited to, all operating and maintenance procedures.\n\n3.9.7.2 Simulation. In some instances, actual hands on demonstration of procedures duplicates similar tasks already\ndemonstrated, needlessly subjects equipment to damage, activates one-time items such as Electro-Explosive Devices (EED)\nor exposes the technician to personal injury. In these cases, the procedures may be simulated by observing the operational\ncon\ufb01guration of the equipment while studying the task to ensure that procedures are logical, effectively descriptive and can\nbe accomplished.\n\n3.9.7.3 Desktop Analysis. Desktop analysis involves side-by-side comparisons of source data with TO data (text, links,\nillustrations, etc.). Non-procedural data and any procedural data where veri\ufb01cation by performance/simulation has been\nwaived will be veri\ufb01ed by desktop analysis. Desktop analysis is usually performed during IPRs or (especially during\nsustainment) pre-publication reviews. When an IPR is waived or new data is incorporated after the IPR, a separate desktop\nveri\ufb01cation will be required.\n\n3.9.8 Veri\ufb01cation Procedures. Speci\ufb01c veri\ufb01cation procedures for the system under development shall be documented in\nthe TOLCVP.\n\n3.9.8.1 Veri\ufb01cation Site.

The TOMA or TCM will act as, or task the MAJCOM to appoint a VTM to\ncontrol veri\ufb01cation. Speci\ufb01c roles and responsibilities of the VTM shall be documented in the TOLCVP. The VTM will\ncoordinate with all affected agencies to ensure the availability of facilities, equipment and personnel to conduct the veri\ufb01-\ncation. When the data or procedures are delivered and all required hardware, support equipment, personnel, supplies and data\nare available, the VTM will schedule and supervise the veri\ufb01cation effort, including pre- and post-veri\ufb01cation meetings.\n\n3.9.8.3 Pre-Veri\ufb01cation Meeting. The VTM will conduct a pre-veri\ufb01cation meeting with the veri\ufb01cation team to ensure\nteam members are aware of responsibilities and duties. Subjects to be covered during the meeting include the maintenance\nconcept, any reference documentation available, the speci\ufb01c TOs and procedures to be veri\ufb01ed, safety precautions, docu-\nmentation required and individual team member assignments. Team members will review the procedures prior to beginning\nany task veri\ufb01cation.\n\n3.9.8.4 Veri\ufb01cation Tasks. The VTM will supervise the actual veri\ufb01cation effort. The VTM will make every effort to\nresolve problems on-site to prevent delaying or canceling veri\ufb01cation. Checklists will be veri\ufb01ed simultaneously with the\nparent manual. A separate AFTO Form 27 will be completed on each TO or portion of a TO and checklist veri\ufb01ed to\ndocument discrepancies and the overall results of the veri\ufb01cation. The TO VSP will be updated to re\ufb02ect the veri\ufb01ed status.\nVeri\ufb01cation of TO updates may be recorded on the document creating the update (AFTO Form 22, 252 or AF Form 847).\nVeri\ufb01cation of ETMs and IETMs/S1000D based TOs must be performed on the electronic viewing devices (e-tools) desig-\nnated for operational use. Speci\ufb01c veri\ufb01cation tasks include:\n\n3.9.8.4.1 Performing the procedures to verify usability by personnel with the planned skills and training, ensuring the\narrangement of material and method of presentation support the operations or maintenance concept.\n\n3.9.8.4.2 Observing and reporting any safety violations or hazardous conditions. STOP operations if necessary.\n\n3.9.8.4.3 Performing TO RGL computations, if not documented by the contractor.\n\n3-19\n",

A copy of\nthe AFTO Form 124 or contractor equivalent will be included in the TO documentation package for each TO maintained by\nthe TOMA.\n\n3.9.8.4.3.2 RGL computations may be computer-generated or performed manually using any accepted computation pro-\ncedure. The actual RGL can be computed automatically by many word processing and publishing software packages. If\nonline resources are used, the web address and method used should be included in the RGL documentation for review and\n\ufb01ling. Computations will be reviewed during IPRs.\n\n3.9.8.4.4 Ensuring all actions and suggested or required TO changes are fully documented.\n\n3.9.8.5 Veri\ufb01cation Updates. The TOMA must ensure updates due to veri\ufb01cation are accomplished on an expedited\nbasis. Expedited updates should be restricted to those of a technical nature affecting operation and maintenance procedures.\nExpedited editorial changes will be restricted to those affecting comprehensibility. Changes based on personal preference\nmust be submitted through the normal TO change process.\n\n3.9.8.6 Post-Veri\ufb01cation Meeting. The VTM will conduct a post-veri\ufb01cation meeting to resolve any problems, generate\nthe minutes, and assign action items as required. VSPs will be updated as required. The Veri\ufb01cation Record section of an\nAFTO Form 27 will be used to document any discrepancies found in the TO or procedures during veri\ufb01cation, and recom-\nmend either further veri\ufb01cation or formalization of the TO. The form will be submitted to the TOMA (or TO Review Board\n(TORB)/Flight TORB (FTORB)) for approval. When approved by the TOMA, the AFTO Form 27 recommending formal-\nization will be used as authority to prepare the formal TO. Discrepancies found during veri\ufb01cation of TO updates may be\nrecorded on the document creating the update. The program CE or equivalent will approve veri\ufb01cation results for TO\nupdates.\n\n3.9.8.7 Veri\ufb01cation Review Boards. All comments and changes developed as a result of veri\ufb01cation must be approved\nby a review panel, normally a TORB or FTORB, prior to incorporation in the TO. This review panel should consist of\npersonnel from activities involved in the acquisition or modi\ufb01cation program, as determined by the TOMA and documented\nin the TOLCVP, including veri\ufb01cation team members and the contractor. The \ufb02ight manual review panel must include at\nleast three rated officers. After review, coordination and approval, the changes will be sent to the contractor for update of the\nTO involved, and if veri\ufb01cation was completed successfully, preparation of the formal manual. Review boards are not\nrequired for TO updates provided the CE approves the changes.\n\n3.9.8.8 Veri\ufb01cation Documentation. Each veri\ufb01cation effort requires complete documentation, including minutes and\nany forms generated. For concurrent contractor/government testing, contractor records will be included with veri\ufb01cation\ndocumentation. Veri\ufb01cation activities and results of TOs under development or being updated as part of a modi\ufb01cation\nprogram will be documented using an AFTO Form 27. (See Chapter 4 for veri\ufb01cation during sustainment). The TOMA will\nmaintain a \ufb01le of all veri\ufb01cation documentation issued for the life of the TO covered.\n\n3.9.9 Technical Order Pre-Publication Reviews. The TOMA and IPT will ensure that veri\ufb01cation comments and cor-\nrections are incorporated and that manuals meet contractual requirements. A formal pre-publication (pre-pub) review may be\nrequired. Pre-pub reviews are scheduled and conducted by the TOMA, as called for in the IMP. Pre-pub reviews are an\nexamination of the master TO or update reproducible \ufb01le prior to delivery to ensure incorporation of changes resulting from\nveri\ufb01cation, recommended changes, and as a \ufb01nal check on contract compliance. Pre-pubs are not required in every case, the\nTOMA decides if one is needed on a TO-by-TO basis, depending on number and complexity of changes from veri\ufb01cation\ncontractor performance on updating previous TOs, etc. Every effort should be made to include veri\ufb01cation team members at\npre-pub reviews to enhance continuity. If necessary, an AFTO Form 158, Technical Order Review Comment Sheet, may be\nutilized during the pre-publication review.\n\n3.9.10 Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) and Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS). TCMs/PMs must ensure the\nprocedures in TOs minimize the generation, use and disposal of HAZMAT and ODS IAW AFPD 32-70 and associated\ninstructions. Any use of HAZMAT and ODS must be justi\ufb01ed by the contractor and approved by TCM/PM. Materials used\nand methods for use of material must comply with AF regulations especially as to effects on health and the environment\n(AFOSH STDs and AFI 32-70xx Series).\n\n3.9.11 Contractor Furnished (Aeronautical) Equipment (CFAE/CFE) Notice Processing and Tracking Procedures.\nAs system or commodity development proceeds, the prime contractor or subcontractors may identify additional hardware\nsupport requirements or components of the end item that require separate or additional TOs for operation and maintenance of\nthe end item or commodity. CFAE/CFE Notices are normally submitted by contractors when required by a CDRL item, or by\n\n3-20\n",

The\nnotices identify the purpose and use of speci\ufb01c technical manuals for the operation, maintenance and inspection of equip-\nment used with the end-item system or commodity, and which are not already covered by the TO development contract. The\nmanuals may be MILSPEC TOs, commercial manuals, or contractor data developed for the government.\n\n3.9.11.1 CFAE/CFE Content. CFAE/CFE content is speci\ufb01ed by DID DI-TMSS-80067, Contractor Furnished Aeronau-\ntical Equipment/Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFAE/CFE) Notices . Notices should be checked to be sure all blocks are\n\ufb01lled in (i.e., contract number and date, submitting contractor name and vendor code, publisher name and vendor code, stock\nnumber, con\ufb01gured item number, etc.) Incomplete or inaccurate notices should be returned to the contractor for corrective\naction. CFAE/CFE notices should be revised and resubmitted or superseded whenever the item represented undergoes\nsigni\ufb01cant change or data requirements change.\n\n3.9.11.2 Federal Stock Class (FSC). The FSC of the equipment covered is listed on the CFAE/CFE notice. The FSC is\nused with the D086, Mission Workload Assignments System, to determine the prime office responsible for management of the\ncommodity and manual involved.\n\n3.9.11.3 CFAE/CFE Procedures. The TOMA or TCM shall establish a procedure for reviewing and processing CFAE/\nCFE inputs. The procedures for processing CFAE/CFE notices shall be documented in the TOLCMP and updated throughout\nthe program life cycle as needed. The procedure must stipulate who reviews CFAE/CFE notices for each type of document\nrecommended and who has ultimate approval authority for acceptance and numbering of the recommended documents.\n\n3.9.11.4 CFAE/CFE Approval. Upon approval of a CFAE/CFE notice, the TOMA forwards a letter through the appro-\npriate contracting office notifying the contractor of the TO number assigned, title (if other than proposed), license rights and\ncopyright release statements, quantities required, and shipping instructions (if not covered in the contract TMCR).\n\n3.9.11.5 CFAE/CFE Disapproval. If the CFEN is disapproved, full justi\ufb01cation must be provided. If the item has been\nclassi\ufb01ed as a non-reparable or throwaway item, the appropriate PM must be noti\ufb01ed to ensure the equipment is covered in\nthe supportability analysis database. If disapproval is due to errors in CFAE/CFE notice preparation rather than unnecessary\nor unsuitable data, the TOMA should immediately inform the contractor to allow timely revision and resubmittal of a\ncorrected CFAE/CFE notice to avoid costly delay.\n\n3.9.11.6 Military Speci\ufb01cation TOs. As system or commodity development proceeds, contractors may identify additional\nhardware support requirements or components of the end item that require separate TOs for operation and maintenance of\nthe item or commodity. For new SE, the contractor may submit a SERD, accompanied by any required CFENs (DI-TMSS-\n80067). Contractors may develop their own processes for notifying the government of new SE requirements, as long as all\nLogistics Management Information (LMI) required to make accept/reject decisions is provided. For new manuals to support\nend item components, only the CFEN is required. CFENs may not be required if all TO requirements can be completely\nde\ufb01ned in advance in the contract (usually on less complex projects).\n\n3.9.11.7 CFAE/CFE/CFEN Notice Status. Depending on the number of contractors and volume of COTS data, a\ndatabase for each contractor should be maintained with summary pages showing status of each notice, as well as individual\nwork sheets on each notice providing more detailed information on actions taken.\n\n3.9.11.8 New Support Equipment. For new SE, the contractor will submit a SERD accompanied by any required\nCFAE/CFE notice (DI-TMSS-80067). Contractors may develop their own processes for notifying the government of new SE\nrequirements, as long as all data required to make accept/reject decisions is provided. For new manuals to support end item\ncomponents, only the CFAE/CFE notice is required. CFAE/CFE notices may not be required if all TO requirements can be\ncompletely de\ufb01ned in advance in the contract (usually on less complex projects).\n\n3.9.11.9 SERD Review. Each SERD submitted must be reviewed and approved as directed by the PM before the\nequipment can be used with the end item. Disapproval of the SERD usually disapproves any associated CFAE/CFE notices.\nFor approved SERDs and end item components, associated CFAE/CFE notices must be reviewed for applicability, need for\na stand-alone manual, depth of coverage recommended, etc. and approved separately.\n\n3.9.11.10 Contractor Data. In lieu of developing MILSPEC TOs, the contractor may recommend use of in-house con-\ntractor format technical data. The CFAE/CFE notices and the data recommended must be reviewed and approved like\ncommercial manuals.\n\n3-21\n",

When the contractor recommends use of commercially available\nSE or end item components, use of manufacturer manuals customarily provided with the commercial article may also be\nrecommended. Copies of the COTS manuals are attached to the CFEN recommendations for government review and\napproval IAW MIL-PRF-32216. CFENs on COTS manuals must include the contractor evaluation of suitability based on\nMIL-PRF-32216. See Section V for additional information when working with COTS programs.\n\n3.9.11.12 Developing Supplemental Data. When supplemental data is required to make the manual acceptable, the\ncontractor should be contacted to determine if the additional data can be obtained from the vendor or if the contractor will\nhave to develop such data. Depending on the reply, the additional data shall be obtained and the manual returned for\nreevaluation. If the required data cannot be obtained from the vendor, a cost estimate for the development of the additional\nrequired data must be provided.\n\n3.9.11.13 COTS Manual Records. Each program must establish a list to track proposed COTS manuals. The list should\ninclude CFAE/CFE Notice numbers, date approved or disapproved (with disapproval reasons), contractor, prime responsible\noffice, ship dates for the approved manuals, and whether or not the manuals were received at the appropriate destination. A\nfollow-up letter should be sent to the ALC responsible for the commodity and the supporting manual to ensure receipt and\nauthorize contractor payment.\n\n3.9.12 Computer Program Identi\ufb01cation Number (CPIN) Items. Software program tapes and control documentation\nwill be referenced in TOs using only the basic CPIN. XXX may be used in the last three alpha-numeric position of a CPIN.\nUsers MUST check the ACPINS compendium for the latest version and revision for their application. CPIN revision/version\nshall not be published in TOs without coordination and written approval of the CPIN PM. If revisions/versions are used, the\nTOs must be updated on a priority basis to re\ufb02ect changes in the revision/version numbers and dates of programs authorized\nfor use in the Automated CPIN System (ACPINS).\n\n3.9.13 Other Program Reviews Affecting Technical Manuals.\n\n3.9.13.1 Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews (PDRs and CDRs). PDRs and CDRs address many issues which\naffect the TOs. Automatic versus manual testing, maintainability requirements, special tools, unique support equipment, and\nspecial skills are discussed. A common contractor practice is to propose changing TO procedures rather than hardware design\nto overcome de\ufb01ciencies. TOs must NOT be used to compensate for design de\ufb01ciencies.\n\n3.9.13.2 Functional and Physical Con\ufb01guration Audits (FCAs/PCAs). These events are critically important to the\nTOMA because they form the basis for establishing the production baseline con\ufb01guration of the hardware/software items\nunder development. All technical manuals are required to re\ufb02ect the production baseline and therefore, any program which\nschedules TO delivery before these events have been accomplished, is not acceptable.\n\n3.9.13.3 Provisioning Reviews. Provisioning is the process of cataloging all of the parts expected to be procured as\nreplacement spares throughout the life of the program. This review is critical to the Illustrated Parts Breakdown manual\nbecause the output of the provisioning effort will determine the depth and level to which an item will be repaired or replaced.\nThe purpose of provisioning activities is to ensure integration of support elements such as production, support equipment,\ntechnical manuals/orders, training, and facilities. The provisioning conference provides for the government to make item\nselection and assign technical and management codes. It is imperative that only personnel well quali\ufb01ed in their technical\nspecialty attend provisioning conferences and that continuity of personnel be maintained throughout the item development.\nIn all cases, representatives must be authorized to make commitments for their activity. The TOMA should be involved in\nthe conference to ensure that official Source, Maintainability and Recoverability (SMR) codes are assigned and are given to\nthe contractor, through the Contracting Officer, for publication in the IPB or the numerical index of the IPB IAW MIL-DTL-\n38807, Technical Manuals, Illustrated Parts Breakdown. See AFMCI 23-101 and the Product Support Tool Kit (PSTK),\n(formally known as the A&S Tool Kit) (Paragraph 1.3.3) for additional guidance on provisioning activities and conduct of\nthe provisioning conference.\n\n3.9.13.4 Supportability Analysis Reviews. The supportability analysis process is a review of tasks performed to exam-\nine all elements of a proposed system to determine the logistics support required for the system; and to in\ufb02uence the design\nso that both the system and support can be provided at an affordable cost. Supportability data is the foundation for identi-\nfying and managing support resources including: supplies, support equipment, technical orders, training resources and\ncon\ufb01guration management. Supportability data is acquired as part of the technical data package of the weapon system\nacquisition and contributes to the sustainment processes: data management and con\ufb01guration management as well as form-\ning the basis for maintenance and supply. Supportability data links the allocated baseline of the weapon system to the\nphysical baseline and integrates technical and engineering data with maintenance and supply data and forms the basis for\nmanaging the sustainment of the weapon system. The TOMA should be involved in the supportability review conferences to\n\n3-22\n",

Sustainment-phase TO\nupdating procedures are in Chapter 4. The TOMA is responsible for ensuring that TOs remain current and accurate through-\nout the acquisition phase by contracting for TO updates.\n\n3.10.1 RFPs and Contracts. The RFP Instruction to Offerors section must address TO maintenance as a requirement of\nthe program. The contractor will propose coverage requirements and update cycles. Best practice is to contract for TO\nmaintenance in renewable options once the initial TO development contract is completed, to allow the Air Force time to\nassume the TO maintenance role.\n\n3.10.2 Engineering Change Proposals (ECP). Updates to TOs as a result of an ECP are normally considered to have\nthe same contractual status as the ECP. In other words, if the ECP is in the scope of the contract, so is the TO update; if the\nECP is out of scope, the cost for updates to the TOs must be included in the ECP costs.\n\n3.10.3 Update Submittal. Updates are submitted on several different forms, known collectively as Recommended Changes\n(RC). RCs for PTOs are generally submitted on AFTO Form 27 (Figure 3-2) IAW procedures speci\ufb01ed in the program\nTOLCMP. The AFTO Form 27 may also be used in lieu of the AF Form 847 for preliminary Flight Manuals. The TOMA or\n\n3-26\n",

The change process to be used during TO development along with the routing\nand approvals required shall be documented in the TOLCMP and updated as required throughout the program life cycle.\n\n3.10.4 Update Approval and Incorporation. The TOMA must ensure that all involved agencies are made aware of the\nrouting and approval requirements. Because the Air Force may not have the capability to perform an engineering evaluation\nof suggested changes during acquisition, the contractor is often tasked to provide this support. Normally, a TO Review Board\n(TORB) and Flight TO Review Board (FTORB) are established to review, approve and determine veri\ufb01cation requirements\nfor all proposed PTO updates. After updates are approved by the TORB/FTORB, the TOMA sends them to the contractor for\nincorporation in the affected TO.\n\n3.10.5 Veri\ufb01cation. All changes to technical data procedures, no matter how they are published shall be veri\ufb01ed by\nperformance or as otherwise speci\ufb01ed by this TO.\n\n3.11 TYPES OF PRELIMINARY TECHNICAL ORDER UPDATES.\n\nThe types of updates used with formal TOs (TO 00-5-1) will also be used with PTOs during acquisition. In addition, an\napproved AFTO Form 27 may be inserted into the PTO as an interim update. This would normally be done only in cases of\nwork stoppage or to eliminate safety hazards. The TOMA must issue an index page with each RC/update to identify all\ncurrent updates; the index page will be dated and identify the PTO, updates, and organizations affected.\n\n3.11.1 Procedures for AFTO Form 27. The AFTO Form 27 is the primary vehicle for submitting updates and improve-\nments to PTOs. The AFTO Form 27 will be used by the TO veri\ufb01cation team, and, when authorized by the TOMA, other\nusers of PTOs on all programs. The criteria for submitting and processing Emergency, Urgent and Routine AFTO Form 27\nare speci\ufb01ed below. Completion instructions are in Figure 3-2.\n\n3.11.2 Use Period. The TOMA is responsible for determining when the AFTO Form 27 will no longer be used to\nrecommend updates or improvements to PTOs. This is normally after veri\ufb01cation has been completed. The period of use will\nbe speci\ufb01ed in the TOLCMP.\n\n3.11.3 Processing AFTO Form 27. RCs and updates are categorized as Emergency, Urgent or Routine. The update\ncategory is based on its impact to the system, mission effectiveness, safety or maintainability. Emergency and Urgent\nsubmittals should be limited to technical and safety-related changes. Change processing and update time limits are speci\ufb01ed\nin Table 4-1. Changes to report categories will not be made without the express concurrence of the TOMA and the submit-\nting MAJCOM.\n\n3.11.3.1 Emergency RCs. Emergency recommendations require immediate action on a TO de\ufb01ciency which, if not\ncorrected, WOULD result in a fatality or serious injury to personnel, extensive damage or destruction of equipment or\nproperty, or inability to achieve or maintain operational posture (MISSION ESSENTIAL), including \ufb01eld-level work stop-\npage. In addition, emergency includes discrepancies that directly affect the handling, maintenance, operations, transportation,\ntesting, and testing or storage of nuclear weapons. The TOMA/TCM or designated representative must provide written\ncorrective action or downgrade the RC within 48 hours (72 hours for work stoppage) of receipt.\n\n3.11.3.2 Urgent RCs. Urgent recommendations require action on a TO de\ufb01ciency which, if not corrected, COULD cause\none or more of the following: personnel injury; damage to equipment or property; reduce operational efficiency, and/or\njeopardize the safety or success of mission accomplishment. Submit RCs that could result in over $25,000 or 1000 man-\nhours annual savings to the Air Force as urgent. All technical TCTO de\ufb01ciencies are submitted as urgent. Identi\ufb01cation of or\nreplacements for EPA Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) and ODS are submitted as urgent. In addition, urgent includes all\nother discrepancies that indirectly affect a nuclear weapon and technical orders that indirectly affect the handling, mainte-\nnance, operations, transportation, training, and testing or storage of nuclear weapons.\n\n3.11.3.3 Routine RC. Routine recommendations require action on TO de\ufb01ciencies that do not fall into emergency or\nurgent categories.\n\n3.11.4 Airman Powered by Innovation (API) Program. The IDEA program has been renamed to the Airmen Powered\nby Innovation (API) program. AFI 38-402, Airman Powered by Innovation (API) Program provides guidance for the API\nprogram. This guidance and procedures apply to ideas submitted as of 1 June 2013. Website reference at https://ipds.afpc-\n.randolph.af.mil. Approved reports which could be eligible for submission of an after-the-fact idea will have AFTO Form 22,\nBlock 18 annotated with the expected tangible or intangible bene\ufb01ts and justi\ufb01cation.\n\n3-27\n",

After-the-fact APIs may only be submitted on approved routine RCs to PTOs in acquisition if they\nprovide an improved work procedure or method, such as welding in lieu of fasteners, or local repair instead of discard.\n\n3.11.4.2 Ineligible Updates. RCs identifying errors in TOs or procedures prior to formalization, i.e., wrong screws,\nerroneous measurements, incorrect references, typographical errors, etc., are ineligible for the API program. Corrections of\nthis type are an integral part of the TO development process.\n\n3.11.4.3 Submission. Submit the improvement or enhancement from an approved RC through the Idea Program Data\nSystem (IPDS), attaching a copy of the approved RC to the idea. The API evaluator (normally the same individual who\napproved the RC) will determine job responsibility, validate savings/bene\ufb01ts, and recommend approval of the idea. API\nbene\ufb01ts must be documented in IPDS when the submittal is made. The IPDS will base the award on the validated RC data.\nIf the RC is not eligible for an after-the-fact API award, the API evaluator will indicate the reason for disapproval in IPDS.\n\n3.11.5 Disposition. The TOMA or designated representative will forward approved RCs to the contractor for incorpora-\ntion in the next update to the PTO or TO.\n\n3.11.6 Interim Update Procedures. If approved routine recommended changes cannot be published within the time\nframes of Table 4-1, an Interim Operational Supplement (IOS) will be generated by the TOMA, if requested by the users.\n\n3.12 CONTROL AND TRACKING OF RECOMMENDED CHANGES.\n\nThe TOMA must develop a system to track and control RCs from the time requests are received or generated until incor-\nporation into the TOs. The TOMA also should address how much outstanding content will be allowed and for how long\nbefore considering preparing a clean WA-1 revision. Speci\ufb01c items to be recorded include date received/initiated, action\ntaken, date disapproved or forwarded to contractor, and date incorporated. The method for tracking will be speci\ufb01ed in the\nTOLCMP. AFTO Form 27 must be maintained on \ufb01le for at least two years, IAW the Air Force Records Information\nManagement System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule, (https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm).\n\n3.13 CLASSIFIED RECOMMENDED CHANGES.\n\nRCs containing classi\ufb01ed data will be marked with the proper classi\ufb01cation and appropriate downgrading and declassi\ufb01ca-\ntion instructions IAW DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1/ AFI 16-1404. The program Security Classi\ufb01cation Guide (SCG) will be\nreferred to when determining if classi\ufb01ed data is included. Unclassi\ufb01ed RCs on classi\ufb01ed TOs will be marked: This is an\nunclassi\ufb01ed AFTO Form ____________________ on a classi\ufb01ed manual. Security violations involving TOs will be reported\nIAW DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1/ AFI 16-1404, not by use of a RC.\n\n3.14 TECHNICAL ORDER UPDATES DUE TO EQUIPMENT MODIFICATION OR REPLENISHMENT SPARES\nPROCUREMENT.\n\n3.14.1 Requirements. New speci\ufb01cation requirements, modi\ufb01cations and replenishment spares procurement can result in\nnew inventory items for replacement or replenishment issue. New TOs may be required and/or existing TOs updated or\nrescinded.\n\n3.14.2 Coordination and Advisement. The TCM will coordinate with the reparable assembly or system PM to determine\nif safety, life support or critical systems are involved. The TCM and TOMA will identify and advise affected TOMAs, PMs,\nSAP users and other DoD agencies (Army, Navy, etc.) of the proposed new or modi\ufb01ed equipment/end item and recommend\nupdating of affected TOs. Advisement must include known systems or commodities TOs, when stocks of the original\nequipment/end item TOs will be exhausted, and speci\ufb01c TO updates required (if known). Coordination and advisement\nrequirements are not required for common National Stock Class items (e.g., nuts, bolts, resistors, etc.) unless safety, life\nsupport, or critical systems or material are involved. In conjunction with the TOMA, the TCM will initiate acquisition of\nnew TOs or TO updates for commodities/equipment/end items under TCM control. Notify the TOMA in writing to rescind\nobsolete TOs as required. Keep MAJCOMs informed of the TO status and anticipated publication date(s). Follow up with\nthe MAJCOM to ensure TO updates are distributed and support requirements of users have been satis\ufb01ed.\n\n3.15 UPDATE DISTRIBUTION AND FILING.\n\nThe provisions of TO 00-5-1 do not apply to the distribution of PTO updates or RCs approved for use with PTOs during\nacquisition. The TOMA must make arrangements to provide copies of approved updates to all affected users of the PTOs.\nRACs, ISSs and IOSs to PTOs will be posted the same as for formal TOs. RCs approved for operational use will be posted\n\n3-28\n",

For\nexample, both types of program will require some degree of acquisition strategy and some acquisition planning, the main\ndifference is, there is far more planning required for a large aircraft development program, than for a small hydraulic jack\nprogram. Also, many of the smaller programs typically do not require all of the same number of personnel to administer the\nprogram. Major events which have a direct effect on smaller TO programs are included below.\n\n3.16.1 Data Call. Used by Program Offices to solicit requirements for smaller programs. These events replaced the more\nstructured Data Requirements Review Boards in many instances. The TOMA is a key player along with the IPT members in\ndetermining the scope and depth of each new program. Data calls are an integral part of the requirements development\nprocess.\n\n3.16.2 Technical Manual Contract Requirements (TMCRs). Technical manuals requirements are similar in both Major\nand Minor acquisitions. Refer to Paragraph 3.6.1 for a further explanation.\n\n3.16.3 DD Form 1423 - CDRL and CLIN for TOs. See Paragraph 3.6.4 for further explanation.\n\n3.16.3.1 The TOMA may include draft CDRLs for known data requirements in the RFP. The CDRL for TO delivery (if\nincluded), with the TMCR attached, will be referenced in RFP section J. The Instruction to Offerors will require the offerors\nto develop SOW paragraphs, complete CDRL tailoring and submit any other suggested data requirement CDRLs with the\nproposals.\n\n3.16.3.2 If CDRLs are not included in the RFP, the Instruction to Offerors will require offerors to propose all data\nrequirements, including TOs. In this case, a partly-tailored TMCR may be placed in either the system speci\ufb01cation or the\nProposal Technical Library.\n\n3.16.3.3 Justi\ufb01cation. Offerors must justify each data requirement included in proposals. The TOMA or program data\nmanager will complete DD Form 1423 (CDRLs) for approved requirements. See DoD 5010.12-M for DD Form 1423\ninstructions.\n\n3.16.4 Initial TO Guidance Conference/Post Award Conference. Refer to Paragraph 3.9.2.\n\n3.16.4.1 Negotiations. Negotiations can also occur during the performance of the contract for Engineering Change\nProposals (ECP), Contract Change Proposals (CCP), or as a result of differences in contract interpretation. TOMA partici-\npation remains the same whatever the reason for negotiations, and must be performed through the PCO.\n\n3.16.4.2 Additional Evaluations. Evaluate ECPs, associated TCTOs, and CCPs against the baseline contract to ensure\ncosts correspond to the original proposal and were not included in the baseline costs. Some TO updates as a result of ECPs\nshould be included in the routine periodic update program, and some proposed additions to the number of TOs developed or\nacquired may be included in contract baselines. Evaluate the ECPs/CCPs against similar items previously submitted by the\ncontractor.\n\n3.16.4.3 Contract Adjustments. If, for any reason, the contractor does not perform some functions as originally proposed\n(for example, when schedules are accelerated and revised need dates prevent some quality checks, or vital support equipment\nwill not be available in time), an equitable adjustment to the contract/order price should be negotiated. The PCO will manage\nnegotiations and may or may not require TOMA support.\n\n3.16.4.4 Guidance Conference/Post Award Conference. The IPT, with the contractor included, holds a Guidance\nConference or a Post Award Conference where program plans are reviewed and approved, and schedules are established. The\ntiming is usually within 60 days after contract award to avoid delaying contractor tasks. The contractor can initiate TO\npreparation after the TO guidance conference. Refer to Paragraph 3.9.2 for additional information.\n\n3.16.4.5 Management and Scheduling. Refer to Paragraph 3.9.2.\n\n3-33\n",

COTS manuals are generally devel-\noped at contractor expense and are sellable as a commodity item, the USAF must deal with issues, i.e., proprietary data\nrights, copyright restrictions, and a myriad of different formats for this type of data. TOMAs cannot assume that just because\nthe USAF purchased a COTS item, that the government owns the rights to the technical data. Each contractor can set their\nown restrictions on the sale, printing, distribution, and storage of COTS technical data. The below paragraphs explain the\nunique requirements for review and approval of COTS data.\n\n3.18.1 COTS Manuals and Other Commercial/Contractor Data. COTS Manuals are acquired using the USAF TMCR\n(TM 86-01) for centrally procured and managed (NSN\u2019s assigned) equipment, no matter the format, and will be evaluated\nfor effectiveness and content IAW MIL-PRF-32216, Evaluation of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Manuals and Prepa-\nration of Supplemental Data. If acceptable, or if they can be supplemented to be acceptable, they will be adopted as TOs\n(given a TO number) and indexed in ETIMS. This will NOT include COTS manuals for locally purchased equipment. Local\npurchase manuals and software must be controlled and managed by the procurement activity.\n\n3.18.2 COTS versus New Development. Existing commercial operating instructions, parts breakdown handbooks, and\nrepair manuals will be acquired instead of developing new TOs if no degradation in system operation, safety, support or\nreliability will result IAW AFI 63-101/20-101. Using existing data will save money and time for the TO program. COTS\nmanuals will be reviewed and evaluated by the TOMA, MAJCOM and assigned Equipment Specialist (ES) IAW MIL-PRF-\n32216.\n\n3.18.2.1 Commercial aircraft maintenance and operations (\ufb02ight) manuals (FMP) proposed for use by Air Force personnel\nmust be reviewed by the TCM and FMM compared against both MIL-PRF-32216 and MIL-DTL-7700, Flight Manual,\nPerformance Data Appendix, Mission Crew Manual, Supplemental Manual, and Abbreviated Flight Crew Checklist and\nother requirements.

Failure to consider this possibility could result in aircraft accidents or incidents.\n\n3.18.2.2 Approved manuals will be adopted for Air Force use, assigned a TO number and managed in the TO system\nunless a waiver is approved. Approved manuals will be developed to identify pertinent information associated with COTS\nManuals. An Identifying Technical Publication Sheet (ITPS) shall be posted as a cover page immediately on top of the\nCOTS manual title page or safety summary and shall provide all necessary information about the manual to include\nde\ufb01nition of the AF limits of releasability and/or data rights.

Manuals used for organic (Air Force) operations or maintenance will be included in\nthe TO System unless a waiver is approved by HQ AFMC/A4F. When different user organizations have different operation\nor maintenance support concepts, manuals will be managed in the TO System unless a waiver is approved by HQ AFMC/\nA4F.\n\n3.18.2.4 PMs must ensure, through the TOMA, that all contracts issued for procurement or sustainment of commercial or\nmilitarized commercial systems and commodities require delivery of applicable FAA, manufacturer or vendor technical data\nupdates (service bulletins, operations manual bulletins, FAA airworthiness directives, temporary revisions, etc.). Use a DID\n(when available), or ensure the CDRL for TO delivery requires delivery of these updating publications.\n\n3.18.2.5 The TCM, TOMA, depot engineering or technical support activity and/or FMM will determine if any updates\nreceived apply to TO-numbered \ufb02ight and/or maintenance manuals, and if the updates will be referenced by the commercial\nnumber or will have the information extracted for inclusion in supplements or other TO updates. When a COTS TO user\nbecomes aware of a later version of the COTS manual that applies to their equipment (and not just to a later model/version\nof the equipment), they should notify the ES/TCM so that he/she can evaluate the later manual version for adoption by the\nAir Force. If adopted, the TO will be indexed in ETIMS.\n\n3.18.2.6 For programs using temporary or Interim Contractor Support (ICS) contracts (support required until organic\ncapability is attained), data used by the contractor to ful\ufb01ll the terms of the contract is excluded from numbering and\nmanagement in the TO System. However, if this data will transition to the Air Force, it is subject to review and veri\ufb01cation\nby Air Force personnel. COTS and contractor manuals transferring to the Air Force will comply with this TO and MIL-PRF-\n32216. Data developed for system or equipment contractor internal use, if later purchased by the government, will be treated\nthe same as COTS data.\n\n3.18.2.7 When operation and/or maintenance are planned to be Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), whether the military\nsystem or end item is commercially available or is developed speci\ufb01cally for the Air Force, the PM or SCM acquires,\nnumbers, and manages the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) data outside the TO system (no TO numbers are assigned).\nHowever:\n\n3.18.2.7.1 The data is subject to Air Force technical content, reproducibility and rights reviews to ensure it is adequate for\ncompetition of follow-on contractor support (\u2019Adequate\u2019 means usable by another contractor with comparable skills and\nexperience to ful\ufb01ll the terms of the contract).\n\n3.18.2.7.2 Data developed or modi\ufb01ed speci\ufb01cally for the CLS contract shall be certi\ufb01ed by the contractor; Air Force\nveri\ufb01cation is not required.\n\n3.18.2.7.3 Pre-existing, unmodi\ufb01ed commercial data shall be certi\ufb01ed for adequacy and accuracy by the contractor ac-\nquiring the data for the CLS contract.\n\n3-39\n",

TOs can contain classi\ufb01ed data up to and including Secret Restricted Data. The following procedures\napply to classi\ufb01ed and unclassi\ufb01ed TOs containing data whose distribution must be controlled. TOMAs and TCMs/FMMs\nwill:\n\n3.19.1.1 Verify TO data classi\ufb01cation using the applicable Security Classi\ufb01cation Guide (SCG). For contractors, the\napplicable SCG may be listed in the DD Form 254,Contract Security Classi\ufb01cation Speci\ufb01cation, Department of Defense.\nEnsure the TO title page and each page and paragraph in a classi\ufb01ed TO is marked IAW DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1 and AFI\n16-1404.\n\n3.19.1.2 Issue classi\ufb01ed technical data in supplemental TOs to the maximum extent possible to keep the majority of TOs\nunclassi\ufb01ed (TO 00-5-1). TO titles will be unclassi\ufb01ed to the maximum extent possible.\n\n3.19.1.3 Use the applicable SCG as authority to classify TO data needing security protection. Review contractor-prepared\nclassi\ufb01ed Preliminary Technical Orders (PTOs) to ensure they have the proper security markings annotated IAW DoDM\n5200.01, Vol 1 and AFI 16-1404. Advise the contractor of any required revisions to the PTOs or DD Form 254.\n\n3.19.1.4 Review classi\ufb01ed technical data during every TO update action or at least annually for possible classi\ufb01cation\ndowngrading according to the applicable SCG or DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1. TCMs must ensure their TOs are reviewed in a\ntimely manner. The task schedule should be set for less than one year to allow time to complete the review within the\nrequired one-year period. Initial data for overdue currency review tracking may be obtained from HQ AFMC/A4F.\n\n3.19.1.5 TO classi\ufb01cation changes are disseminated via a TO change or revision and listed in the Search New, Updated\nand Inactive TOs function of the AF TO Catalog.\n\n3.19.1.6 Issue unclassi\ufb01ed updates to Classi\ufb01ed TOs whenever possible.\n\n3.19.1.7 Do not use the Not for Foreign Release (NOFORN) marking on TOs. In accordance with DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1,\nInformation Security Program, this code is only authorized for U.S. intelligence information.\n\n3.19.1.8 Unclassi\ufb01ed Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI) is a special category of information. To be considered for\nprotection as DoD UCNI, the information must be unclassi\ufb01ed, pertain to security measures, including plans, procedures,\nand equipment, for the physical protection of DoD Special Nuclear Material (SNM), equipment, or facilities, meet the\nadverse effects test; i.e., that the unauthorized dissemination of such information could reasonably be expected to have an\nadverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by increasing signi\ufb01cantly the\nlikelihood of the illegal production of nuclear weapons or the theft, diversion, or sabotage of DoD SNM, equipment, or\nfacilities. (Ref DoDD 5210.83).\n\n3.19.2 Classi\ufb01cation Upgrades. HQ AFMC must concur in the interpretation of the cited classi\ufb01cation authority for\nupgrading the classi\ufb01cation of an already-distributed TO (if the TO was too widely distributed, reclassi\ufb01cation may not be\npossible.) Notify HQ AFMC/A4F and the local Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) (Security Forces) of the\ncircumstances requiring an upgrade by classi\ufb01ed message. Include the new level of security classi\ufb01cation, the classi\ufb01cation\nauthority, the number of copies issued, the length of time the information has existed at a lower classi\ufb01cation and if the\ninformation is available from unclassi\ufb01ed sources.\n\n3.19.2.1 A4F shall consult with HQ AFMC to determine whether the security classi\ufb01cation action is Original Classi\ufb01ca-\ntion Authority directed. If so, a classi\ufb01ed message furnishes authority to begin the upgrade action.\n\n3.19.2.2 The TCM prepares an Emergency Interim Operational Supplement (IOS) or RAC IAW Chapter 4, to upgrade the\naffected TO, and noti\ufb01es the responsible TOMA to update the TO index entry.\n\n3-43\n",

The latest revision\nto AFI 33-360 has replaced these distribution codes (F and L) with a releasability statement. However, the old\ncodes will continue to appear on older AF publications for some time. The code F meant Public Release for\nstandard publications, but no release without Controlling DoD Office permission for technical data. AFI 33-360\nused Limited (L) Distribution.\n\n3.19.4.1 Distribution Statements. Controlling DoD Offices (CDO) i.e., FMMs and TCMs, shall mark interim and formal\nTOs, TCTOs, PTOs, TO updates, source data, and other technical data (see de\ufb01nitions) with appropriate distribution state-\nments before dissemination IAW DoDI 5230.24 and AFI 61-201. Include the word \u2019Statement\u2019 in your title \u2019Distribution\nStatement D\u2019. Apply the single most appropriate distribution statement A, B, C, D, E, or F (for secondary distribution) IAW\nDoDI 5230.24 enclosure 5. Apply the distribution code/letter designator and verbiage IAW DoDI 5230.24. You may use as\nmany reasons that apply to the code/letter and content of the technical data. Include the Date of Determination and the\nControlling DoD Office (PM\u2019s organizational symbol and program name). Verbiage for distribution statements and reasons\nmay NOT be modi\ufb01ed IAW DoDI 5230.24. In addition, for B, C, D, and E distribution statements, you may include\n\u2019Secondary\u2019 and the following text that precedes the distribution statement: \u2019The (Controlling DoD Office) authorizes\nsecondary distribution, release, and dissemination to the extent permitted by this distribution statement without additional\napprovals or authorizations.\u2019 TOMAs shall ensure the distribution code and reasons are re\ufb02ected in the index record for\nindividual TOs. New DoDI 5230.24 guidance states Distribution Statement F is to be used under rare and exceptional\ncircumstances and only when a speci\ufb01c authority exists or when need-to-know must be veri\ufb01ed. See DoDI 5230.24 for\noptions, (i.e., Executive Orders, statues such as Atomic Energy Federal regulation, etc.)\n\nNOTE\n\nSubsequent dissemination of formerly Distribution\nStatement X documents shall display Distribu-\ntion Statement C, with export control as the rea-\nson, and shall be marked as directed by DoDI\n5230.24, unless changed by the controlling DoD\noffice.\n\n3.19.4.1.1 Signi\ufb01cant Military Equipment (SME). For purposes of determining the appropriate distribution markings for\nAir Force TOs, and other technical documents, controlling offices shall refer to the United States Munitions List (USML),\nthe Commerce Control List (CCL), and the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) IAW AFI 61-201. The USML\ndesignates some technical data items as Signi\ufb01cant Military Equipment.

This technical information shall be restricted solely to U.S.\nDoD activities or U.S. DoD contractors who hold contracts to speci\ufb01cally support such military equipment or have a\nlegitimate business relationship with the DoD. The DoD has the sole responsibility for determining that a legitimate business\nrelationship exists since the only purpose is to provide access to information created by or under the control of the DoD.\nAcceptable distribution statements are D, E or F.

TOs for public release must be reviewed and assigned a case\nnumber by the local Public Affairs (PA) office prior to release. (AFI 35-102, Air Force Security and Policy Review\nProcess). Ensure other required title page statements and warnings are applied IAW AFI 16-201,\nInternational Affairs and\nSecurity Assistance Management, and MIL-STD-38784, Manuals, Technical: General Style and Format Requirements.

If derived documents are generated from the parent\ntechnical data, apply the parent document distribution control markings to the derived documents, unless the purpose was to\npublish unrestricted data in an unrestricted document.\n\n3.19.4.1.5 COTS Manuals. Distribution Statements must be assigned to COTS manuals when they are adopted as TOs.\nIn cases where the Air Force has unlimited rights, this may be Distribution A, because these manuals are publicly available\n(a PA release certi\ufb01cate is still required).

For additional training on the STINFO program, see the courses at https://af-aqweb.deps.mil/pages/default.aspx or\ncontact your local STINFO Officer.\n\n3.19.5 Digital TO Security. Security issues and procedures are covered in DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1, AFI 16-1404, AFI\n17\u2013100, Air Force Information Technology (IT) Service Management, AFI 17\u2013130, Cybersecurity Program Management, Air\nForce Systems Security Instruction (AFSSI) 8520, Identi\ufb01cation and Authentication, and AFI 61-201 among others. User\naccess to and distribution methods for digital TO \ufb01les must provide adequate security for classi\ufb01ed and limited-distribution\nTO data \ufb01les (Paragraph 5.5). Classi\ufb01ed TO \ufb01les must be encrypted using a National Security Agency (NSA)-approved\nencryption algorithm, while limited-distribution \ufb01les require a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-\napproved encryption system prior to being hosted on servers. Except for distribution statement A documents, TO \ufb01les must\nbe encrypted and hosted on a secure Internet https server with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certi\ufb01cate or user name and\npassword access control.\n\n3.19.5.1 Encryption. NIST has approved use of strong encryption technology (128-bit capable/export controlled) pro-\nvided by the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol for use with unclassi\ufb01ed, limited distribution technical data. Each organi-\nzation planning to provide access to TO/TO updates via the Internet must establish a secure server with the SSL protocol\ninstalled. Access to the server must be controlled by the use of PKI certi\ufb01cates or user names and passwords. In some cases,\ndomain restrictions (.mil, .gov) might be used for DoD and/or government agency access, combined with user name and\npassword access for authorized contractors. Additional information and assistance should be obtained from the local Com-\nmunications (Comm) Squadron.\n\n3.19.5.2 Password Protection.\n\nExercise extreme care when manipulating digital TO \ufb01les as technical content must not be altered unless autho-\nrized in writing by the CE (Paragraph 2.1.3).\n\nAll secure servers must be protected by PKI certi\ufb01cates or user name/password access controls. The System Administrator\n(SA) is responsible for assigning user names and passwords for protection of a secure server. When necessary, the user name\nand password will be provided in a secure email message to TODOs requiring access to RACs and new baseline TO \ufb01les.\nThe SA is also responsible for periodically changing passwords to help prevent unauthorized access and protect the infor-\nmation on the site. TOMAs who previously chose to password protect digital TO \ufb01les may be required to provide the\npassword to select subscribers using an authorized, secure method. This will enable subscribers to manipulate digital TO\n\ufb01les in support of their unique requirements, such as custom printing.\n\n3.19.6 Controlling Distribution of Technical Orders. TOMAs must control the distribution of TOs to eligible recipients\nIAW DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1/ AFI 16-1404, AFI 61-201, and for reasons speci\ufb01ed in this TO. For Air Force TO System\nimplementation of the STINFO Process, TO Distribution Offices (TODOs) complete the primary distribution process on\nbehalf of the Controlling DoD Offices (CDO), to any accounts and may make primary distribution to any accounts and\nsub-accounts based on mission requirements. If proprietary TOs must be distributed to Government-Owned, Contractor-\nOperated (GOCO) Accounts, the contractor personnel must have signed non-disclosure agreements on \ufb01le with their com-\npany.\n\n3.19.6.1 Export Controlled TOs. The TOMA, in conjunction with the TCM, will determine if any TOs containing export\ncontrolled data (DoDI 5230.24 and AFI 61-201) require sponsor approval to satisfy the distribution control requirements\nof AFI 61-201. In general, export controlled TOs may be released to all F*xxxx and E*xxxx accounts. FMS (D*xxxx)\naccounts must request TOs through the Security Assistance Technical Order Data System (SATODS) and have Foreign\nDisclosure Office (FDO) (IAW AFI 16-201) approval prior to release for initial subscription or requisition. AFMC Centers\nwill document local procedures for controlling the distribution of export controlled data in a supplement to this TO.\nException: Nuclear Weapons TOs are managed at the AF Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) and are not to be placed in\nSATODS.\n\n3-46\n",

TOMAs and FMMs are responsible for distributing TOs to authorized\nusers. In some cases, this could include determining (in conjunction with the TCM) whether to release or withhold TOs\nrequested by individuals or companies through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process. FOIA requests for TOs\nmarked D, E or F for Administrative or Operational Use, Proprietary Data or Direct Military Support shall be refused using\nExemption Number 3 (DoDM 5400.07, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program). For determining whether it is appro-\npriate to release a TO, it is USAF interpretation of DoD policy that Air Force Technical Orders are solely intended for direct\nsupport of military and weapon systems. As such, release shall only be authorized to U.S. DoD contractors as de\ufb01ned in\nDoDI 3200.14, DoD Scienti\ufb01c and Technical Information (STI) Program (STIP), and DoDI 5230.24, Distribution State-\nments on Technical Documents. Other requests for Air Force TOs shall be referred to the Controlling DoD Office (CDO,\ngenerally the TCM or FMM). Example: although the CDO may make exceptions, others cannot; and may share Distribution\nStatement D TOs only with DoD units or with DoD contractors with active contracts for the weapon system covered by the\nTOs in question. The FMM is the responsible release authority for Accident Investigation Boards (AIB) requests; with regard\nto any possible public domain release of \ufb02ight manual data. Contractors responding to Requests for Proposal (RFP), when\nquali\ufb01ed, may access relevant weapon system TOs in a Bidders Library or electronic \ufb01le maintained by the RFP-issuing\nprogram office or contracting office IAW TO 00-5-1.\n\n3.20 RIGHTS IN TECHNICAL DATA.\n\n3.20.1 De\ufb01nitions.\n\n3.20.1.1 Technical Data.

TOs, commercial manuals, and\ncontractor data may be copyrighted and/or contain proprietary data. TOs and non-commercial contractor data are procured\nwith Unlimited Rights, Government Purpose Rights, or Limited Rights (see below) using Defense Federal Acquisition\nRegulation Supplement (DFARS) clauses at 252.227-7013. Commercial manuals are procured with the same types of rights\nusing DFARS clauses at 252.227-7015. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, if the manuals were prepared for or\nacquired by the government pursuant to the contract, the contractor should grant the government a license allowing repro-\nduction, distribution, use and development of derivative works, or to have others do so for the government. (Derivative\nworks are publications such as checklists and workcards developed from one or more basic manuals.) The distribution of the\nmanuals outside the government shall be done strictly IAW the contract and applicable regulations (DFARS part 227.7103-5,\netc.). For example, when the government has only limited rights in the data, the license is limited by the de\ufb01nition of limited\nrights in the DFARS. In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the government\u2019s needs or the government\nmay be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for other consideration. However, the licensor is not obligated to\nprovide the government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights\nprovided in the standard grant of license.\n\n3-47\n",

For technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the\nlicense is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When the technical\ndata do not pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used to\ncreate the data.\n\n3.20.2.2 Unlimited Rights. Unlimited rights means rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose\ntechnical data in whole or in part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do so\n(DFARS 252.227-7013(a)(15)).

Government purposes include\ncompetitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose\ntechnical data for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so (DFARS 252.227-7013(a)(11)). Government purpose\nrights means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display or disclose technical data within the government\nwithout restriction; and release or disclose technical data outside the government and authorize persons to whom release or\ndisclosure has been made to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform display, or disclose that data for U.S. government\npurposes (DFARS 252.227-7013(a) (12)).\n\n3.20.2.4 Limited Rights (DFARS 252.227-7013)(a)(13). Limited rights permit the government to use, modify, repro-\nduce, release, perform, display or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the government. The government may\nnot, without the permission of the party asserting the limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the\ngovernment; use the technical data for manufacture; or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except:\n\n3.20.2.4.1 The government may reproduce, release or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data\nby persons outside the government if reproduction, release, disclosure or use is necessary for emergency repair or overhaul;\nor\n\n3.20.2.4.2 A release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such\ndata by, a foreign government that is in the interest of the (U.S.) government and is required for evaluation or informational\npurposes;\n\n3.20.2.4.3 Subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure or use; and\n\n3.20.2.4.4 The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is noti\ufb01ed of such reproduction, release, disclosure or\nuse.\n\n3.20.2.5 Copyrights.

The data may not be used to manufacture\nadditional quantities of the commercial items and, except for emergency repair or overhaul, may not be released or disclosed\nto, or used by, third parties without the contractor\u2019s written permission.\n\nSECTION VII SOURCE DATA\n\n3.21 GENERAL.\n\nSource data, as used in this TO, is information of any sort used to develop or update TOs. The contractor uses source data\nfrom program development and test for program TOs. The TOMA must acquire any source data required to develop or\nupdate non-program TOs (e.g., weapon data to update aircraft loading TOs) or to assist associated contractors with TO\ndevelopment or update (e.g., a support equipment vendor). The TOMA must follow up on source data delivery to ensure that\nTOs to be developed or updated will be published in time to meet program milestones.\n\nNOTE\n\nSource data developed organically by the Air Force does not require certi\ufb01cation, but must be veri\ufb01ed prior to\ndelivery or incorporation into a TO.\n\n3.21.1 Types of TOs Requiring Source Data. Types of TOs where source data would be required include, but are not\nlimited to, Aircraft Emergency Rescue, EOD/RSP, Munitions Loading, Munitions Positioning and Tiedown, Weapons De-\nlivery, and Explosive Storage and Maintenance manuals. Source data on support equipment provided by other contractors is\nrequired for prime contractor developed TOs.\n\n3.21.2 Procedural Source Data. Procedural data is a special category of source data required during most TO develop-\nment and acquisition programs. This data is a similar and organized grouping of the data required to perform operations and\nmaintenance tasks on a military system or commodity item. The data is acquired when development of a stand-alone TO is\ninappropriate, or when TOs managed by other agencies must be updated. The content of procedural data is determined by the\nappropriate contract requirements, and includes text, diagrams, illustrations, charts, schematics and other data required to\ndescribe the procedures and support equipment.\n\n3.21.3 Source Data OPRs. OPRs requiring source data must be included in program TO Planning/Requirements Con-\nferences (Paragraph 3.4.1) to ensure data requirements are speci\ufb01ed accurately in RFPs and contracts. OPRs munitions-\nunique OPRs and requirements are covered in this chapter.\n\n3.21.4 Delivery. The contractor provides certi\ufb01ed, adequate, safe and accurate source data as required by the contract. The\nTOMA must work with the source data recipient to ensure that data provided is adequate. Delivery requirements may differ\nbetween OPRs and users as well. In some cases a single delivery may be sufficient, while other cases require deliveries or\nupdates throughout the period of the contract.\n\n3.22 ACQUISITION OF SOURCE DATA.\n\n3.22.1 Development. Many different MIL-SPECs and DIDs may be used to procure source and procedural data, includ-\ning those for Standard Data Packages (SDPs), engineering drawings, test and inspection reports, interface control documen-\ntation, and supportability analysis tasks. EOD source data is acquired using DI-SAFT-80931, Explosive Ordnance Disposal\nData. Aircraft Emergency Rescue Information (Fire Protection) source data is acquired using DI-TMSS-81532, Aerospace\n\n3-49\n",

Procedures for source data acquisition are the same as for TOs. Source data requirements\nare determined during the TO Guidance Conference. In-Process Reviews are held as required. The contractor applies internal\ncerti\ufb01cation management processes and delivers an adequate, accurate data package for Air Force veri\ufb01cation. After veri\ufb01-\ncation is complete, the contractor makes corrections as required; the package receives a \ufb01nal review if necessary and is\ndelivered to the appropriate agency.\n\n3.23 NONNUCLEAR WEAPONS DELIVERY SOURCE DATA - WEAPONS SOURCE DATA PACKAGE (AIR-\nCRAFT -34 SERIES TECHNICAL ORDERS AND TO 1-1M-34).\n\nThe Weapons Source Data Package (WSDP) provides aircrew weapons delivery information for newly developed or modi-\n\ufb01ed nonnuclear munitions.\n\n3.23.1 Requirements. The WSDP is developed to support four main requirements: (1) AFMC Development Test and\nEvaluation (DT&E); (2) Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E); (3) revisions to both aircraft-speci\ufb01c weapons\ndelivery manuals (-34 series) and the TO 1-1M-34 series Standard Volumes; and (4) user-unique Flight and/or Weapons\nDelivery Planning Programs. (Planning Programs provide the user with automated ballistic solutions for mission planning.)\n\nNOTE\n\nFor weapon systems with authorized release to FMS countries, a separate WSDP is developed for each country\nwith approved FDO release IAW AFI 16-201.\n\n3.23.2 Contents. WSDP data consists of a section for generic munitions data and sections of aircraft-speci\ufb01c data for\neach aircraft which will employ the munitions item.

Delivery envelopes for unguided and laser guided GBU-10/12/16/27/28/54 series munitions are\nnormally developed by the Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO), 46 SK/SKA, from computer simulation programs.\nEnvelopes for precision guided munitions (six degree of freedom or 6DOF weapons) are normally provided by the weapon\ncontractor as a part of the WSDP.\n\n3.23.4 Procedures and Responsibilities.\n\n3.23.4.1 WSDP acquisition participants are the munitions TOMA, MAJCOM(s), aircraft PMs, AFLCMC/LZSA-Eglin (for\nTO 1-1M-34), the Responsible Test Organization (RTO) and AFSEO.\n\n3.23.4.2 The contractor develops the WSDP to meet established program schedules; the package should be delivered at\nleast 30 calendar days prior to the start of DT&E. During IPRs, the WSDP is reviewed for use of common and standard\nterms for munitions items. Contractor QA is limited to Desk-Top Analysis.\n\n3.23.4.3 RTOs and AFSEO use the WSDP during aircraft/munitions testing to verify procedures. AFSEO initiates action,\nif required, to incorporate the weapons data into the Combat Weapon Delivery Software (CWDS) mission planning program.\nThe testing agencies document any discrepancies and forward them to the munitions TOMA for action. An updated WSDP\nmust be available 30 days prior to the start of IOT&E.\n\n3.23.4.4 MAJCOMs and support agencies use the WSDP during IOT&E and forward any additional discrepancies to the\nmunitions TOMA.\n\n3.23.4.5 The munitions TOMA distributes the \ufb01nal WSDP to the appropriate aircraft PMs, AFLCMC/LZSA-Eglin, 102\nWest D Ave, Suite 160, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5415, DSN 875-7990 (for TO 1-1M-34), and AFSEO, 46 SK/SKA, 205 West\nD Ave, Suite 348, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6865, DSN 872-0450.

This includes ALL new or modi\ufb01ed aircraft, munitions, delivery systems such as Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles and Unmanned Ground Vehicles and ordnance items that contain explosives, propellants, and/or hazardous chemi-\ncals.\n\n3.25.1 EOD TOs. Category 60 TOs (and source data) differ from maintenance TOs in that EOD TOs provide information\nand guidance rather than detailed step-by-step procedures. These TOs are typically used in accident, incident, mishap,\ndud-dropped and dud-\ufb01red situations where the systems or items have been damaged or failed to function as designed and\nstandard TO maintenance procedures cannot be used.\n\n3.25.2 Air Force Liaison. AFCEC/CXE is the Air Force centralized agency for EOD data acquisition and liaison with the\nNSWC IHEODTD.\n\n3.25.3 Requirements. The EOD source data package is developed to support three main requirements: (1) RTO need for\nemergency EOD, RSP and (if required) recovery procedures during DT&E operations, product improvement testing, failure\nanalysis, and initial space vehicle deployment; (2) MAJCOM need for emergency EOD and RSP during OT&E operations;\nand (3) Development of the Joint Service Category 60 TOs by NSWC IHEODTD.\n\n3.25.4 Participants. The TOMA will invite EOD representatives from AFCEC/CXE, the RTO, and MAJCOMs to the TO\nPlanning/Requirements Conference. AFCEC/CXE will normally be delegated as the representative for other EOD activities.\nAt the conference, the representatives will identify and justify requirements for data for EOD operations, and commodities\nand recovery equipment to support EOD TO certi\ufb01cation and veri\ufb01cation, and determine delivery schedules. EOD SDP is\ndeveloped IAW DID DI-SAFT-80931.\n\n3.25.5 Delivery. Critical delivery dates are initial delivery for DT&E, delivery for OT&E, and delivery for TO develop-\nment. TO development may take up to 12 months, depending on availability of hardware for veri\ufb01cation. DoD requires\ndelivery of veri\ufb01ed TOs 30 days prior to \ufb01elding/stockpile (DoDD 5160.62 and AFI 32 -3001).\n\n3.25.6 EOD SDP Procedures.\n\n3.25.6.1 The contractor develops the SDP IAW DI-SAFT-80931. The package should be delivered at least 60 calendar\ndays prior to the scheduled delivery of assets for Air Force testing. During IPRs, the SDP is reviewed for conformance to\nitem and system con\ufb01guration and identi\ufb01cation of Hazardous Item Recovery Candidates required for recovery and test\nfailure analysis. AFCEC/CXE or a designated representative will participate in the Contractor certi\ufb01cation process.\n\n3.25.6.2 The AFMC EOD RTO supporting system or commodity testing will integrate the SDP data into the Test Support\nProject for the system or commodity and submit the project to a Safety/Hazard Review Board for approval before use.\nDuring DT&E, the RTO will document any comments or discrepancies with the SDP on an AFTO Form 27, and forward the\nform to the TOMA and AFCEC/CXE. If at any time the data is determined to be no longer safe for use (due to errors in the\ndata, modi\ufb01cations to the hardware, or other reasons), the RTO will stop testing, notify the TOMA of actions required to\nresolve the problem(s), and obtain corrections prior to continuing testing. AFCEC/CXE and the MAJCOM EOD represen-\ntative must review and approve the DT&E-revised SDP prior to further use.\n\n3.25.6.3 Procedures for OT&E are the same as for DT&E, except that the EOD RTO is usually a MAJCOM agency and\nmust ensure the MAJCOM has approved the data for use. The OT&E-revised SDP is used to support development of the\njoint service Category 60 TO. The TOMA will re-verify the user TO need date and ensure the AFCEC/CXE schedules have\nincorporated the date.\n\nNOTE\n\nNSWC IHEODTD is a working capital fund organization and charges a fee based on EOD TO SOW complexity.\n\n3-53\n",

NSWC\nIHEODTD formulates a SOW and cost estimate to create or revise an EOD TO. NSWC IHEODTD provides a copy of the\nSOW to the responsible program office for funding. Once the \ufb01nal SDP (i.e., con\ufb01guration lock) and funding is received, the\nTO should be completed in 180 days. AFCEC/CXE initiates the joint service development project with NSWC IHEODTD\nand establishes a distribution need date, based on the Required Assets Available (RAA) and/or the Initial Operational\nCapability (IOC) date of the weapon system. The NSWC IHEODTD in concert with the four service detachments will\ndevelop, validate, verify and publish the TO for DoD EOD use. Distribution and publishing will be via the Joint EOD Portal\nand JEOD MFK software. JEOD MFK software is distributed quarterly (Mar, Jun, Sep, and Dec). Some foreign customers\nmay receive EOD TOs in Adobe.PDF format when the NSWC IHEODTD International Programs Office (IPO) determines\nthem releasable.\n\n3.25.6.5 The TOMA monitors the development process to ensure required support equipment is available, any hardware\ncon\ufb01guration changes are forwarded, and delivery schedules will be met. If veri\ufb01ed TOs will not be available in time to meet\nDoD and user requirements, the TOMA must work with AFCEC/CXE to develop interim support procedures.\n\nSECTION VIII DIGITAL TECHNICAL ORDER AND TECHNICAL MANUALS\nSPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS (TMSS) REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.26 DIGITAL TECHNICAL ORDER DATA.\n\n3.26.1 Policy. All major TO modi\ufb01cation programs must perform a Cost Bene\ufb01t Analysis (CBA) to acquire, convert\nlegacy and sustain TOs IAW ASD-S1000D and MIL-STD-3048. If the CBA does not support or justify development or\nconversion to S1000D, TOs shall be developed in accordance with current TMSS. Program-speci\ufb01c TO requirements must\nbe identi\ufb01ed using the S1000D Decision Point Tool located at https://techdata.wpafb.af.mil/tmss/index.html to identify\nProgram-speci\ufb01c functionality requirements and business rules, included in the program TMCR and documented in the\nTOLCMP. The AFLCMC/LG TO Home Office must be consulted by the Program Office TOMA for advice, assistance, and\napproval in developing, publishing and using these documents. In all cases of S1000D development, programs shall adhere\nto MIL-STD-3048. Refer to https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12316.\n\n3.26.1.1 The authoritative version of ASD-S1000D and MIL-STD-3048 are identi\ufb01ed in the TMCR (Paragraph 3.6.1)\ndocument. The CBA tools, TMCR template, USAF S1000D Decision Point Tool located at https://techdata.wpafb.af.mil/\ntmss/index.html and TOLCMP template, are available on the TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.\n\n3.26.1.2 For modi\ufb01cation programs, if the CBA does not support or justify development or conversion to S1000D, TOs\nshall be sustained in existing digital formats in compliance with current TMSS. Before converting legacy (existing) TO data\nto a new authoring format, use and changeability must be considered. In many cases, converting hard-copy TOs to word-\nsearchable PDF \ufb01les is sufficient for user needs, and is compatible with ETIMS distribution and viewing.\n\n3.26.1.3 Type 2 Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) and Interactive Electronic Technical Publications\n(IETPs) are currently exempt from distribution in ETIMS until such time as ETIMS becomes capable of handling these\neTOs. (See waiver procedures and format at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12837/default.aspx). As part of the Type 2 IETM/\nS1000D based TO development process, the program office shall be responsible to establish and maintain a distribution\nsystem capable of distributing the TOs. However, as the Type 2 IETM/S1000D TOs are developed, the TOMA shall index\nthem in ETIMS (-WA-2) so prospective users can begin establishing subscriptions. The ETIMS Catalog shall be maintained\nby the TOMA for IETM/S1000D based TOs.\n\n3.26.1.4 AF TO Programs desiring to implement S1000D/IETM initiatives shall utilize all available/applicable AF (APL)\ntools and resources for the implementation and organic sustainment of IETM/S1000D tech data, i.e., Content Management\nSystem (CMS), distribution and COTS/GOTS viewing software, etc. Systems and/or tools provided by the contractor shall\nbe made interoperable with AF infrastructure/technology.\n\n3.26.1.5 S1000D/IETM programs currently utilizing contractor provided technology such as viewer software, distribution\nsystems and or content management solutions shall make every effort to migrate tech data into available/approved Air Force\nsolutions if technically interoperable and economically practical.\n\n3.26.1.6 To deviate from AF TMSS or S1000D standards when acquiring, converting, or sustaining TOs, TOMAs must\nrequest a program waiver through their PM, Lead Command/A4 and Center Home Office to HQ AFMC/A4. The request\nmust include a CBA showing authoritative savings over the life-cycle of the program and proof of compatibility with ETIMS\nand all other AF information systems and product life cycle support databases.\n\n3-54\n",

A waiver prepared according to Para-\ngraph 3.26.1.6 must be approved to deviate from this policy unless BCA (Paragraph 3.26.1) determines migration to S1000D\nis more cost effective. AFLCMC/HIAM maintains a web site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12316/default.aspx) where all of the\nstandard DSS are maintained and made available to acquisition.\n\n3.26.1.8 The following guidelines apply to DSS decisions:\n\n3.26.1.8.1 When cost effective, always choose the new acquisition DSSs. This ensures TO data is delivered in the most\ncurrent AF format for immediate digital uses and allows efficient reformatting and reuse of the data.\n\n3.26.1.8.2 Make full use of the hyper-linking capabilities that are provided in AF DSSs. These capabilities include full\nand complete use of SGML constructs IDREF, XREF, EXTREF, EXREFID, HYTIME linking, and calls to external pro-\ncesses wherever applicable in the data.\n\n3.26.1.8.3 When a hyper-linking, Web browser-type application is required and the contractor is converting legacy TO\ndata that does not comply with the new acquisition TMSS, re-authoring may be required to apply appropriate structure\n(primary paragraphs, subparagraphs, steps, etc.) and titles must be applied (created) where missing in the legacy TO, using\nthe new acquisition TMSS as a guide.\n\n3.26.1.8.4 Ensure that page-oriented output produced for distribution from SGML (or other structured source formats) is\ngenerated through use of the same publishing system that will be utilized for sustainment of the technical order data. Failure\nto do so can result in increased printing and distribution costs since the output produced by different publishing systems\ndiffers even when the same structured source data is utilized for publishing.\n\n3.26.2 Development of Digital Support Suites. Contractors proposing use of commercial TM speci\ufb01cations or other\nNGS, obsolete TMSS or TMSS with no Air Force DTD/schema and/or stylesheets available from AFLCMC/HIAM, may\ndevelop DSS components needed for use as a \ufb01nal resort. The contractor will be responsible to support the associated costs\nof DTD and update for the usable lifetime of the DSS. The only exception is when AFLCMC/HIAM adopts the DSS for Air\nForce use. If the acquiring organization authorizes the contractor to construct their own DTDs/schemas or DSS (including\nstylesheets, such as XSLT, XSL-FO, CSS, and RSS), the contractor must contact AFLCMC/HIAM for guidance prior to\ninitiating the development process. The following procedures shall be followed:\n\n3.26.2.1 Legacy programs shall use AF TMSS SGML-tagged DTDs, without modi\ufb01cation, for sustainment of legacy\nTMSS developed TOs. AFLCMC/HIAM maintains a Web site where all of the standard DSS are maintained and made\navailable to acquisition (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12316/default.aspx). These DSS provide the SGML templates to be used,\nand are part of the governing speci\ufb01cation or standard. The DSS categorized as new acquisition are the most current versions\nof AF TMSS standards. Those DSS categorized as legacy are not as compliant to the current TMSS, but have options built\nin to allow existing (legacy) TOs to be captured in a more standardized format using SGML. If the program requires\nhyper-linked, interactive TOs, legacy DSS will not provide the desired outcome.\n\n3.26.2.2 For TOs that will be delivered to the AF and organically maintained, the contractor must submit a proposed\ncomplete DSS through the PCO and TOMA to AFLCMC/HIAM for approval to ensure complete compatibility with ETIMS\nand the AF Viewer.\n\n3.26.2.3 AFLCMC/HIAM is the AF approval agency for all non-AF DTDs/schemas and stylesheets to be used for AF\norganic TO maintenance. Approved offeror-proposed speci\ufb01cations will be added to the program TMCR, by contract modi-\n\ufb01cation if necessary. DSS submitted and approved in execution of a contract become the property of the government.\nEXCEPTIONS: DSS for Space and Missile TOs are managed and approved by AFSPC. If TOs are to be maintained by the\ncontractor for the life of the system, SGML and XML based tools developed for electronic TOs are not restrained to ETIMS\ncompatibility.\n\n3.27 USE OF TECHNICAL MANUAL (TM) SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS (TMSS).\n\n3.27.1 TMSS Selection. Preference shall be given to speci\ufb01cations and standards developed under DoDM 4120.24,\nDefense Standardization Program (DSP) Procedures. Air Force TM Standards, MIL-DTL speci\ufb01cations (AF-TMSS) with\nattached DTDs/schemas and stylesheets are required for TO acquisitions.\n\n3-55\n",

It is the responsibility of the Technical Order Manager/Agent (TOMA) to ensure the sustainment process is\nimplemented to ensure currency, completeness and accuracy for support of affected equipment until equipment disposal.\nSustainment includes: updating, numbering, indexing, publication (editing& printing), archiving and delivery to the user. The\nTO content is managed by the Technical Content Manager (TCM) responsible for the equipment covered by the TO, as\nidenti\ufb01ed in the ETIMS Catalog record. Printing, distribution, and overall sustainment management is controlled by the\nassigned TOMA. The Technical Order Life Cycle Management Plan (TOLCMP) describes the TO sustainment activities. See\nParagraph 3.3.2.1 for TOLCMP requirements.\n\n4.1.1 Functions and Corresponding Forms. All TO change recommendations and submittal methods are known collec-\ntively as Recommended Changes (RCs).\n\n4.1.1.1 Prepare TM Change Package Function. Approved RCs from all sources are aggregated by TOMA and once\napproved by the TCM as source data, used by the TCM/TOMA to develop a TO update package that will document the exact\nwording of approved changes for publication in the TO update. The following forms can be used to initiate a recommended\nchange:\n\n4.1.1.2 AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and Reply. TO 00-5-1 contains practices\nand detailed instructions for initiating, reviewing and evaluating AFTO Form 22. Completed forms are submitted via email\nIAW Paragraph 5.5.4 and, if approved, an AFTO Form 252 is prepared by the TCM.\n\n4.1.1.3 AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. AFI 11-215 contains policy and procedures for\nuse of AF Form 847 for submitting changes to Flight Manual Program (FMP) TOs.\n\n4.1.1.4 AFTO Form 27, Preliminary Technical Order (PTO) Publication Change Request (PCR)/TO Veri\ufb01cation\nRecord/Approval. Chapter 3 contains policy and procedures for use of AFTO Form 27 to report discrepancies or recom-\nmend improvements to Preliminary TOs. AFTO Form 27 shall also be used for the approval of veri\ufb01cation completion for\nrevisions, if necessary. The AFTO Form 252 process should not be used to submit proposed changes for preliminary TOs or\nrecord veri\ufb01cation of preliminary TOs.\n\n4.1.1.5 Source, Maintenance and Recoverability (SMR) Code Change Request. Submit an AFTO Form 22 IAW\nTO 00-5-1 and TO 00-20-3, Maintenance Processing of Reparable Property and The Repair Cycle Asset Control System.\nOnce a recommendation for SMR code change is approved, the TCM will submit an AFTO Form 252 for updating the TO.\n\n4.1.1.6 AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and Reply. Depot maintenance activities\nwill use the AFMC Form 202 to request and receive technical data for procedures and repairs beyond existing TO authority,\nIAW AFMCMAN 21-1, Air Force Materiel Command Technical Order system Procedures.\n\n4.1.1.7 AFTO Form 252, Technical Order Publication Change Request. The AFTO Form 252 is the official form to\ndirect changes to AF TOs. An AFTO Form 252 can include content from one or more approved RCs or can be internally\ngenerated by the TCM/FMM. The AFTO Form 252 provides word-for-word instructions on how the TO will be updated. See\nFigure 4-1 for completion instructions. Each internally generated AFTO Form 252 will have a unique Local Control Number\n(LCN). An RC-generated AFTO Form 252 will inherit the Control Number of original RC.\n\nNOTE\n\nFor Technical Management Information System (TMIS) users, use of TMIS system generated LCNs are autho-\nrized.\n\n4-1\n",

If the 120 day\nformal TO change time limit cannot be met, an IOS coversheet (Figure 4-2 ) will be created by the TOMA concurrent with\nthe SH252. The SH252 will be attached, the IOS will be published within the 120 day period and will remain active until the\nformal change can be accomplished.\n\n4.1.1.9 IETM/S1000D Change Process. In some cases, IETM/S1000D RCs may be a built-in function of the IETM/\nS1000D database, which will identify where the de\ufb01ciency is in the database. Non-database RCs must identify the location\nof the data to be updated within the database. In most cases, this will be a step within a task, or an illustration/table.

If an IUID-related, engineering change is processed on a component, subcomponent,\nassembly, or sub-assembly (generically a part) and a published TO speci\ufb01es the overhaul, remanufacture, repair (or assem-\nbly) of that part, that TO shall be updated to specify the processes and location for marking the item by IUID.\n\n\u2022 The IUID marking method shall (in detail or by reference to other TOs) include all inspection procedures, part\nsurface preparation procedures, all marked application procedures, and (unless marked with direct part marking) the\ndata label, data plate, or IUID label part number (e.g. 200945085-XX).\n\n\u2022 The marking location speci\ufb01ed in the TO shall be speci\ufb01c to the part and shall include sufficient detail to re\ufb02ect the\nlocation and tolerances speci\ufb01ed in the Engineering Order (EO). In the case of multiple parts with the same\ncon\ufb01guration (e.g. multiple avionics boxes with the same top level assembly), a common \ufb01gure with multiple\nreferences may be used.\n\n\u2022 Program offices may delay IUID-related updates to TOs which are not intended for AFMC depot use.\n\n4.1.1.10.2 Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB). If the IPB is contained in a separate -4 (i.e., not in the repair manual),\nthen the IPB is not to be used to specify the location or the method for marking a part with IUID. If applying IUID to a part\nchanges a part number in the IPB (e.g., if a new data plate is speci\ufb01ed which differs from the existing data plate called out\nin the IPB), then the IPB shall be updated to show IUID; otherwise, the IPB need not be updated to show IUID label location\nor part number.\n\n4.1.1.10.3 Implementation. TO updates associated with IUID instructions shall be implemented IAW standard proce-\ndures, except as noted below:\n\n\u2022 For those IUID instructions which are required against TOs which are only distributed in paper distribution media\nformat, the TO update shall be implemented as a Special Handling 252 (SH252). These IUID SH252s shall contain\nall of the TO-required information, and may be allowed to remain separate from the TO (i.e. not drive a TO change)\nfor up to 26 months.\n\n\u2022 For those IUID instructions which are required against TOs which are distributed in any other distribution media\nformat or combination, the TO update shall be made via standard methods except that implementation may be\ndelayed by up to six months. This additional delay will allow the grouping of IUID-driven instructions and will\nminimize TO change costs.\n\n4.1.1.11 Special Packaging Instruction (SPI) Related TO Updates. TO updates which may require changes in SPI\nmust be coordinated with the center packaging specialists IAW AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo.\n\n4.1.1.12 Veri\ufb01cation of TOs During Sustainment. All TO updates during sustainment shall be veri\ufb01ed unless waived by\nthe Program Manager (PM) IAW AFI 63-101/20-101.

The TOMA/TCM or designated representative must reply to routine reports\nwithin 45 calendar days of receipt, advising or action taken and the reason when disapproved.\n\n4.1.2.5 TO Updates for Obsolete Systems and Commodities.\n\nNOTE\n\nTechnical Order Page Supplements (TOPS) shall\nnot be used to update TOs for any reason.\n\nObsolete systems and commodities include those still in limited use or scheduled to leave the inventory within two years.\nUsers will continue to submit routine recommended changes for TOs on obsolete systems and commodities. However, the\nTOMA/TCM will hold recommended changes in abeyance pending the decision to rescind or update the TO. The TOMA\nwill provide an adequate schedule for updating the affected TOs when no review is scheduled. In these cases, the updates\nwill normally be published as ITOs. The TOMA will make Emergency and Urgent updates as usual.\n\n4.1.2.6 TOMA Procedures. Upon receipt, managers will process RCs within the time limits speci\ufb01ed in Table 4-1.\nManagers will establish routine update schedules for all assigned TOs, depending upon data criticality and volatility, and\nwhich meet the Table 4-1 time limits. Aggregate all routine RCs received after the cutoff date (publication freeze date) of the\nprevious update and prior to the cutoff for the next update into a single update package for each TO. The action or response\ntime periods for each RC begin with receipt of the RC by the responsible TOMA. The periods end when an update is\ndistributed or the RC is disapproved or determined to be a duplicate submission.\n\n4.1.2.6.1 Exceptions to Evaluation Time. Recommended Changes (RCs) placed in Abeyance, Advisement or Deferred\nstatus (TO 00-5-1) are exempt from evaluation time limits speci\ufb01ed in Table 4-1\n\n4-5\n",

The equipment contractor normally produces CSTO updates under an\nFMS contract. See TO 00-5-19 for further details.\n\n4.1.4.12 Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) Manuals. When AF personnel are authorized to access and use manuals from\nFAA online, the AF TCM will author an Identifying Technical Publication Sheet (ITPS) to 1) authorize the use of the speci\ufb01c\nFAA manual 2) provide FAA online accessing instructions for the speci\ufb01c manual 3) direct AF personnel to monitor FAA\nonline for currency as the ETIMS subscription to the ITPS will only alert them to changes in the ITPS. The TOMA will\nnumber and index the ITPS in ETIMS as a Sponsor Approval, WA-1 eTO, upload the optimized PDF \ufb01le into ETIMS and\nmanage subscription requests.\n\n4.1.5 Digital Technical Order Supplement Procedures. TOMAs will merge all supplements to include making all\nrequired annotations to the TO and supplement. TOMAs shall also link items in supplement, and may bookmark. For\nguidance with these processes, use the Functional Users Guide (FUG) provided on the TOMA SharePoint site at https://\ncs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.\n\n4.1.5.1 Development. Develop the supplement using a word-processing or publishing software program (formatted and\nnumbered IAW TO 00-5-1). Convert it to PDF using Acrobat Distiller\u2122 or PDF Writer\u2122 (part of Adobe\u00ae Acrobat).\n\n4-11\n",

For guidance with these processes, use the FUG provided on the\nTOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.\n\n4.1.5.5.1 Digital Flight Manual Supplements Applied to Checklist Pages. Per AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals\nProgram, \ufb02ight crew checklists can only be supplemented by a supplement to the parent TO. Interim supplements to the\nparent TO affecting \ufb02ight crew checklists will authorize write-in changes to the affected checklist. Formal supplements to the\nparent TO will provide checklist insert pages. In either case, to complete the update process for digital eTOs, the FMM will\nprovide the TOMA PDF insert pages formatted IAW MIL-DTL-7700. The title page will be annotated to show the supple-\nment and date information from the parent TO. The TOMA will merge the pages into the checklist. No linking will be\nrequired since the title page will be the original page as no supplement was released against the checklist, and there will not\nbe separate steps to link.\n\n4.1.5.5.2\ntaining the insert pages will be uploaded and validated, and will be manually deployed using normal processes.\n\nThe checklist not containing the insert pages will be removed from the ETIMS repository, the checklist con-\n\n4.1.6 CD-ROM/DVD Procedures.\n\n4.1.6.1 Responsibilities. The TOMA for a CD-ROM/DVD, with coordination from the PM and Lead Command, is\nresponsible for CD-ROM/DVD content, numbering, indexing, updating, publication, packaging, labeling, and distribution.\nClassi\ufb01ed and unclassi\ufb01ed TOs will not be mixed on a single disk. The TOMA will determine routine CD/DVD update\nintervals, in conjunction with the Lead Command and the TOMA of the individual TOs included on the disk. If a separate\ncontent manager is assigned for the disc, some of these duties may be delegated to that function.\n\nNOTE\n\n\u2022 The use of CD-ROMs/DVDs for unclassi\ufb01ed digital TO distribution and use is being phased out as ETIMS\n\ndistribution and use is implemented. Classi\ufb01ed digital TOs may continue to use CDs/DVDs.\n\n\u2022 The same general rules that apply to CD-ROMs used to publish and distribute TO \ufb01les will apply to DVDs,\n\npending development of a DVD speci\ufb01c publication.\n\n\u2022 AFCEC/CXE is authorized to develop and implement separate procedures for joint service management and\n\nuse of EOD TOs on CD-ROM/DVDs.\n\n4.1.6.2 Content and Labeling.

The standalone TO change or revised TO \ufb01le will be used to produce a master for\nprinting and distribution of paper.\n\n4.1.6.3.2 For emergency and urgent updates, the TOMA or TCM will develop digital RACs whenever possible, instead of\nan IOS or ISS (see TO 00-5-1). The digital RAC \ufb01le will normally be merged with the baseline TO \ufb01le, and the merged TO\nand standalone RAC \ufb01les will be accessed from ETIMS or program web site for distribution. ETIMS users will receive\nautomatic distribution of the merged \ufb01le. The standalone RAC is distributed to allow local printing of the change for\nupdating paper copies of the TO.\n\n4.1.7 Technical Order Update Package Processing. The responsible TOMA will:\n\n4.1.7.1 Screen and Submit Update Packages. Screen all TO update packages to ensure required data is current and\ncomplete, properly coordinated and includes all RCs speci\ufb01ed for the next TO update. Submit approved packages to the\neditorial function for publication of the TO update (specifying the update type), and distribute in the next routine update\ncycle.\n\n4.1.7.2 Record Copy. Ensure a copy of the published update is saved to the repository identi\ufb01ed in the TOLCMP.\n\n4.1.8 Technical Order Update Publication. Updates to individual TOs from all sources (AFTO Form 22, AF Form 847,\nMishap Investigations, Materiel Improvement Projects, etc.) will be consolidated for publication in periodic TO updates\n(revisions, changes, or supplements). Periodic updates will not include modi\ufb01cation-related changes if this would delay\nconcurrent release with the prescribing TCTO. When faced with this situation, out of cycle updates may be necessary to\nsupport the TCTO. Periodic intervals will be determined by the lead command, in conjunction with the PM, but should not\nexceed 365 days. Periodic updates may be delayed beyond the normal update interval if no signi\ufb01cant inputs are received.\nWhen TOs are grouped for publication, for example, a set of TO \ufb01les published on a CD-ROM, it may be necessary to\n\n4-13\n",

Interim Technical Orders (ITOs) are priority, electronically-distributed changes to TOs. Rapid Action\nChanges (RAC) are priority, electronically-distributed changes used in place of ITOs to update TOs. When an interim\nTO/TCTO update is indexed and distributed, TODOs with paper subscriptions will print the supplement portion of the WA-1\n\ufb01le and post to the front of their paper TOs as traditional pen and ink changes. ITOs and RACs are issued to resolve\nde\ufb01ciencies of an Emergency or Urgent nature (see TO 00-5-1). They may revise procedures, deactivate defective subsys-\ntems or components, replace hazardous materials, restrict item use to known-safe areas of operation/\ufb02ight envelopes, or\nremove systems/end items from service, depending on the nature and severity of the hazard.\n\n4.2.1.2 Interim Safety Supplement (ISS). Issue ISSs when circumstances preclude timely publication of a formal TO\nupdate. Issue Emergency ISSs and Urgent ISSs when safety conditions would result in a fatality or serious injury to\npersonnel, or when extensive damage or destruction of equipment or property is involved.\n\n4.2.1.3 Interim Operational Supplement (IOS). Issue IOSs when circumstances preclude timely publication of a formal\nTO update. Emergency IOSs are issued when the MAJCOM is unable to achieve or maintain operational posture (MISSION\nESSENTIAL) or there is a \ufb01eld-level work stoppage. Urgent IOSs are issued for situations that reduce operational efficiency\nor probability of mission accomplishment, provide replacements for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Hazardous\nMaterials (HAZMAT) and Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS), or could result in over $25,000 or 1,000 man-hours annual\nsavings to the Air Force.\n\n4.2.1.4 Rapid Action Change (RAC). RACs are fully-formatted TO changes distributed electronically, used instead of\ninterim supplements as priority TO updates. RACs require the same coordination, advance noti\ufb01cation and approval as the\nequivalent interim supplement.\n\n4.2.1.5 Timelines. An IOS, ISS, or RAC must be issued within 48 hours after receipt of an emergency report (within 72\nhours if report concerns work stoppage), or within 40 calendar days after receipt of an urgent report.\n\n4.2.1.5.1 Emergency IOSs, ISSs and RAC noti\ufb01cations shall be sent to TODOs via an authorized, electronic dissemina-\ntion method (Paragraph 5.5) and receipt acknowledged within two hours. If noti\ufb01cation is required on a weekend or holiday,\nnotify the affected units via the appropriate command post and record receipt acknowledgement. If the emergency supple-\nment or RAC will restrict any Air Force combat weapon system from full capability or operational readiness, provide\nadvance noti\ufb01cation per Paragraph 4.2.1.7. Emergency RACs are made available through an authorized, electronic dissemi-\nnation method (Paragraph 5.5), and must be delivered to sub accounts and libraries within \ufb01ve hours of receipt by the\nTODO.\n\n4.2.1.5.2 Urgent IOS/ISS and RAC noti\ufb01cations shall be sent to TODOs via an authorized, electronic dissemination\nmethod (Paragraph 5.5) and receipt acknowledged as soon as possible during duty hours. Urgent RACs are made available\nthrough an authorized, electronic dissemination method (Paragraph 5.5), and must be delivered to subaccounts and libraries\nwithin one duty day of receipt by the TODO.\n\n4.2.1.6 Security Assistance Program (SAP)/Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Support. IOSs, ISSs, and ITCTOs are\nissued to all FMS customer accounts on ID for the basic TO by the Security Assistance TO Program (SATOP).

Refer to the Flowchart, Figure 4-5. ITOs and RACs are usually prepared by the TCM for the basic TO.\nITO preparation may be delegated to an over\ufb02ow contractor or the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Once an\nemergency or urgent situation is identi\ufb01ed, the responsible activity evaluates it for alternative courses of action. If hazards or\nmission limitations cannot be resolved by a TO change, issue an IOS, ISS, or RAC as appropriate. If there must be an\ninspection or a con\ufb01guration change to the system or equipment, issue an ITCTO (Refer to TO 00-5-15). ITOs and RACs\napplicable to TOs distributed digitally must be in the same digital format as the TO itself. RACs must be merged with the\nTO \ufb01le, and ITOs must be attached to the \ufb01le and digitally linked to the affected TO paragraphs.\n\n4.2.2.1 Developing Interim Supplements.\n\n4.2.2.1.1 Obtain the appropriate TO numbers from the TOMA. Research and develop the revised TO instructions, verify\nand coordinate them IAW this TO. Prepare a replacement interim or formal update if a previously published ITO must be\nchanged before it is incorporated (RACs are incorporated upon issue).\n\n4.2.2.1.2 Replace an ISS with a TO change or revision within 40 days of ISS release. Include IOSs/RACs in the next\nroutine update. EXCEPTION: ISSs and IOSs issued to provide temporary instructions (for example, restrictions to operat-\ning parameters pending completion of a TCTO, use of prototype equipment for \ufb02ight test, etc.) may remain active until\ncompletion of the task or project or for 30 months, whichever is shorter. For revisions, supplements shall be incorporated or\nreissued. Timelines for Interim Safety Supplements pertaining to \ufb02ight manuals can be found in AFI 11-215.\n\n4.2.2.2 Creating Rapid Action Changes (RAC). A RAC is a TO update loosely formatted as a TO Change and distrib-\nuted electronically like an ITO/ITCTO. RACs will be formatted as closely as possible to the manuals they update, and will\ninclude a new title page and List of Effective Pages (LEP), as well as unchanged backing pages for each change page\nincluded. It is prepared using desktop publishing or word processing software and saved in a format compatible with the\nbaseline TO \ufb01le. RACs will be identi\ufb01ed using the next sequential TO change number.\n\n4.2.2.2.1 The TCM will develop the RAC content; the TCM, TOMA or editor will prepare (format) the RAC and create\na merged RAC/basic digital baseline TO \ufb01le for distribution to TODOs. The following steps are involved in creating a RAC:\n\n4.2.2.2.2 The TCM, TOMA or editorial/production activity responsible for formatting the change obtains the digital\nbaseline TO pages affected by the RAC (including title, LEP, data pages and corresponding backing pages), and converts\nthem (if required) into a changeable digital format.\n\n4.2.2.2.3 Make necessary changes to affected pages IAW the approved RC. Title page and LEP format may vary slightly\nfrom the current speci\ufb01cation or parent TO \ufb01le format (e.g., column alignment, font size, dot leaders, graphic lines, etc.).\nThe title page notice must identify the change as an EMERGENCY or URGENT RAC.\n\n4.2.2.2.4 The TCM and TOMA review and approve the RAC.\n\n4.2.2.2.5 Convert the RAC \ufb01le to PDF or other Page Description Language (PDL) software to convert RAC \ufb01les to an\ninsert \ufb01le compatible with baseline TO \ufb01les.\n\n4.2.2.2.6 Merging and Publishing RACs. The TCM, TOMA or editor electronically merges the PDF RAC \ufb01le with the\nPDF baseline TO \ufb01le to create a new baseline TO, and re-links (indexes) the new \ufb01le. The PDF RAC \ufb01le shall also be\nincluded as attachment to merged PDF. Merged \ufb01le with RAC attachment shall be uploaded to ETIMS (Paragraph 5.5.1), to\n\n4-16\n",

Merge and upload non-PDF TO \ufb01les in\nwhatever \ufb01le format was used to distribute the baseline TO \ufb01le.\n\n4.2.2.3 Approval and Release. Approval and release levels are listed in Table 4-2. The TO Management or FMM\ndivisions shall be the only PM functions allowed to release approved ITOs.\n\n4.2.2.4 Indexing. The TOMA will index ITOs and RACs in ETIMS, marking it as local print (which will set the interim\nindicator \ufb02ag to yes), prior to release. Send noti\ufb01cation of release through ETIMS with instructions for TODO on how to\nobtain. RACs will be listed as regular changes.\n\n4.2.3 ITO/RAC Noti\ufb01cation and Distribution.\n\n4.2.3.1 Noti\ufb01cation Messages. When an ITO/RAC is issued, the TOMA or FMM responsible for the TO will notify\naffected TODO accounts using the ETIMS noti\ufb01cation process that the ITO/RAC is available and how to obtain it. The\nETIMS noti\ufb01cation message will be sent within established timelines for Emergency or Urgent changes. ITO/RAC noti\ufb01-\ncations will contain:\n\n\u2022 Affected TO number and title\n\n\u2022 RAC number and date\n\n\u2022 File names and sizes of the merged TO (if applicable) and RAC \ufb01les (sizes are required to ensure users have\n\nenough hard drive space to accomplish the download)\n\n\u2022 Messages must include a point of contact and phone number to call in case of any technical problems.\n\n4.2.3.2 Distribution. TODOs with paper subscriptions will print the supplement portion or RAC attachment of the WA-1\n\ufb01le. If TO does not have a WA-1 media type, any method of electronic distribution described in Paragraph 5.5 may be used.\n\nNOTE\n\n\u2022 Restricted TO \ufb01les must be password protected and encrypted (AFI 33-115), and loaded on an access-con-\n\ntrolled (domain or user name and password) https site.\n\n\u2022 RACs for distribution statement A TOs may be hosted on public web sites.\n\n4.3 TECHNICAL ORDER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES USING ETIMS.\n\nThe TOMA makes changes to management data about a TO using the appropriate ETIMS screens when the correction,\naddition, or deletion of TO management data elements is required. Use the screen completion procedures described in the\napplicable FUG on the TOMA SharePoint site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531). The following paragraphs provide a vari-\nety of tasks that TOMAs must use ETIMS to perform.\n\n4.3.1 Equipment Data Related to Technical Order Acquisition. The TOMA uses the Maintain Equipment List screens\nto input or update Weapon Systems, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes and item part numbers (Refer to\nFUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).\n\n4.3.2 Establishing Sponsor Approval. Sponsor Approval is required on all TOs for which initial subscription and\ndistribution requests must be justi\ufb01ed, reviewed and approved prior to issue. Sponsor Approval is automatically set by\nETIMS when conditions of Table 4-3 exist. The TOMA, in conjunction with the TCM, will determine the need to screen\ndistribution of other unclassi\ufb01ed TOs.\n\n4.3.3 Processing ID Subscriptions Requiring Sponsor Approval. Screen and approve new ID subscriptions when the\nTO is \ufb02agged for Sponsor Approval in the Review Sponsor Approval Request screen in ETIMS. Obtain concurrence of the\nTCM before approving the subscription. Approval/Disapproval shall be completed within 10 calendar days of submittal by\nTODO. (See FUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).\n\n4.3.3.1 Proprietary data may be automatically approved for release to F*xxxx TO Accounts, but may only be released to\na contractor account owning the proprietary rights.\n\n4-17\n",

The TOMA is required to\nsend an ETIMS noti\ufb01cation to the TODOs 30 days prior to rescinding paper media. If paper media is still required, the\nTOMA shall then make the paper Sponsor Approval. The TODO must provide their AF CTOM/MAJCOM representative\njusti\ufb01cation to continue receiving paper TOs (see https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12837/default.aspx). Approved forms will be\ncoordinated with the TOMA. TOMA\u2019s may send subsequent 30-day paper media rescission noti\ufb01cation annually.\n\n4.3.3.4 If paper TOs have FMS customers on ID, the TOMA will not mark the TO as sponsor approval. The TOMA shall\nemail the Security Assistance Technical Order Program (SATOP) office (AFLCMC.EZGTC.Work\ufb02ow@us.af.mil) with the\ninformation and SATOP will contact the FMS customer within 30 days. If the TOMA does not receive a response from\nSATOP within 30 days, the TO will be marked as sponsor approval only. Once SATOP receives a reply, they will contact the\nTOMA. If paper copies are still required by FMS customers, the TOMA shall continue to provide TO paper copies.\n\n4.3.4 Processing Requisition Transactions Requiring Sponsor Approval. TOMAs will receive noti\ufb01cation of One-\nTime Requisitions (OTR) needing sponsor approval through their ETIMS home page. Approval of OTR sponsor approval is\ncompleted in TODPG (See FUG https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).The TOMA will obtain concurrence of the TCM before\napproving the subscription/requisition. Approval/disapproval shall be completed within 10 calendar days of submittal by\nTODO. Justi\ufb01cation is not required for accounts already on subscription for the TO.\n\nNOTE\n\nSubsequent requisitions after an account has approved subscription will not require sponsor approval unless order\nquantity is in excess of the Maximum Issue Quantity (MIQ).\n\n4.3.5 Manage ETIMS Index. The TOMA uses the ETIMS Manage TOs screens, FUG and help screens proce-\ndures, (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531) for changing TO Publication Type, TO Title, Pub Status, Sponsor Approval, Pro-\ngram Group/Name, Lead Command and management data. These screens are also used to add and index TO basics, changes,\nrevisions, and supplements, and to mark rescinded, superseded, renumbered and \u2018FMS only\u2019 for increments, and to enter TO\ncon\ufb01guration and management information for the TO/TO increments.\n\n4.3.5.1 Correct TO Con\ufb01guration and Management Information Errors. ETIMS users report errors in the accuracy or\nquality of ETIMS TO Catalog data using ETIMS DDRs. TOMAs must verify and correct ETIMS Catalog TO record errors\nwithin 7 calendar days after receiving noti\ufb01cation of the error. All ETIMS users will correct errors in the data they are\nauthorized to modify, or will contact the responsible data owner to make corrections.\n\n4.3.5.2 Correct Printing and Distribution Errors. Users can also report errors in the accuracy or quality of printing,\nreproduction and distribution of received TOs through the ETIMS DDR process. All TOMAs who receive issues from users\nwith TODPG problems, printing, reproduction or distribution requirements, etc., that cannot be resolved locally, will report\nthe issues by submitting a ticket to the Field Support Center, which will be directed to their TODPG Site POC. The TODPG\nPOC reviews the ticket and forwards to AF TOFST. If an issue reported to the AF TOFST results in the need for a ticket to\nbe created in the DLA Help System (DASH), then the AF TOFST will create the ticket. The AF TOFST will track the ticket\nin the Field Support Center and DASH systems through \ufb01nal resolution and noti\ufb01cation back to the TODPG POC. Any\nTOMA/User that does not have a TODPG POC, will submit the issue directly to the AF TOFST.\n\n4.3.6 Establish Shipping Priorities. Direct commercial printers to use classi\ufb01ed mailing procedures (DoDM 5200.01, Vol\n1) when distributing classi\ufb01ed TOs. Direct use of \ufb01rst-class mail for all emergency requisitions and for ID shipments of TOs\nand TCTOs to APO/FPO destinations. When using the DLA Data Management Services TODPG for Initial Distribution\n(ID), local DLA Data Management Services facilities will distribute copies to subscribers in their service areas. FMS\ndistribution will be handled by AFLCMC/LZPTC-TINKER.\n\n4.3.7 Establish Maximum Issue Quantities (MIQ). Establish MIQs at a level that will be issued to a TODO without\nadditional justi\ufb01cation.\n\n4.3.8 TCTO Rescission Review. TOMAs will use the ETIMS TCTO Rescission Report to generate a listing of assigned\nTCTOs approaching rescission dates and provide the listing to the TCM. For those within 150 days of rescission, the TCM\nwill evaluate whether to extend the rescission dates or to rescind the TOs early or on the speci\ufb01ed dates. TOMA will then\nupdate ETIMS with a new rescission date or rescind the TCTO.\n\n4-18\n",

These\nreports are available from the \u2018Manage TOs\u2019 screen, such as Requisition Report, TO Number Request Report, Sponsor\nApproval Report, Master Address Report, TO Catalog Report, etc. Procedures for accessing the reports are in the ETIMS\nhelp screens and appropriate FUGs.\n\n4.3.10 Establishing TODO (TO) Accounts. TODO accounts are established in ETIMS following successful processing\nof AFTO Form 43 IAW TO 00-5-1.\n\n4.3.11 Renumbering Technical Orders. The TOMA shall only request TO renumbering to correct serious numbering\nerrors caused by erroneous or insufficient source data before the TO is published and distributed. Published TOs will only be\nrenumbered when the assigned number prevents effective location or use of the TO, or the scope or range of the functionality\ncovered by the TO changes signi\ufb01cantly. TOs will not be renumbered to align with local sequence numbers or similar cross\nreference identi\ufb01ers. The responsible TOMA will request renumbering actions be accomplished through local TO Site\nFunctional office or AF TOFST (for locations without local TO Site Functional office). When renumbering a published TO,\nboth the new and former TO numbers will appear in the upper right corner of the title page with the former number preceded\nby the word Formerly. Both numbers will remain on the title page until the next revision, at which time only the new number\nwill appear. Only the new TO number will appear on the individual updated pages. Unchanged pages will continue to\nindicate the old TO number until they are changed for a reason other than simply renumbering, or until the next TO revision.\nDistribution media suffixes are not included as part of the TO number for the TO itself.\n\n4.3.11.1 When AFLCMC/LZPTP-TINKER approves a new number for unpublished TOs, the TO record is updated and\nsubscriptions submitted against the original number are automatically changed to the new one.\n\n4.3.11.2 When published TOs are renumbered, ETIMS will automatically convert all past revisions and changes to the\nnew number.\n\n4.3.11.3 eTOs distributed from sites other than the ETIMS repository are indicated by a WA-2 media suffix, with the host\nsite URL identi\ufb01ed in the ETIMS TO details page in the WA-2 Repository/System Name Block. The WA-2 numbering is not\nto be used for PDF eTOs. PDF\u2019s should be WA-1 and distributed via ETIMS. An AFMC/A4F waiver is required for the use\nof the -WA-2 suffix, except for the IETMs nuclear weapon TOs (11N), ICBM TOs, and classi\ufb01ed TOs. A WA-2 waiver is\nalso required if a WA-1 suffix version is being distributed via the ETIMS repository and a second media version is to be\ndistributed via a non-ETIMS repository (e.g., an html version for depot operations, distributed from a prime contractor site).\n\n4.3.11.4 The TOMA will number TOs IAW TO 00-5-18, and index and manage digital media IAW this TO. The only\nprocedural difference in numbering and indexing between the types of media is the suffix used to indicate media type. Media\nsuffixes will only be used when indexing and subscribing to the digital versions of the TO, they will NOT appear on the TO\ntitle page.\n\nNOTE\n\nEven though the data on a CD/DVD is digital in\nits format, it is considered physical media.\n\n4.3.12 TCTO Series Numbering. TCTO series header numbers are assigned IAW TOs 00-5-15 and 00-5-18. TOMAs\nwill request a TCTO Series Header using the ETIMS Request TO number screen for an aircraft, missile or engine category\nwhen a new TO series is established. (Refer to 00-5-15) TOMAs will request new TCTO series headers for other TO\ncategories when the \ufb01rst TCTO is in preparation. A separate TCTO series header must be established when individual\nTCTOs in the series will be assigned different classi\ufb01cations. Once a TCTO series header number is approved, ETIMS will\nautomatically number individual TCTOs in the series.\n\n4.4 INDEXING TOS BY MEDIA TYPES.\n\n4.4.1 Media Type De\ufb01nitions.\n\n4.4.1.1 Physical Media: Paper and CD-ROM/DVD.\n\n4.4.1.2 Digital Media: Online Electronic TOs (eTOs -WA-1& -WA-2, IETM/S1000D based TOs).\n\n4-19\n",

When\nTOs will be distributed in two or more distribution media, each media version must be separately indexed in ETIMS. Each\ndistributed media version will have its own TO Number consisting of the approved TO number plus the appropriate\ndistribution media suffix code. (Refer to TO 00-5-18.) Each TO number indexed will be assigned a corresponding Publica-\ntion Stock Number (PSN) as speci\ufb01ed in TO 00-5-18, and paragraphs below.\n\nNOTE\n\nTO Numbers assigned to CD-ROM or DVD disks used for the distribution of single or multiple digital TOs shall\nre\ufb02ect the TO number including the media suffix on the disk and case labels. (Figure 4-4.)\n\n4.4.2 Paper TOs. The paper version of a TO must be marked FMS Only in ETIMS if there are FMS subscribers, even if\nthe US TODOs only subscribe to the eTO version. Consult the spreadsheet on the AFLCMC/LZPTC SharePoint: https://\norg2.eis.af.mil/sites/21763/AFLCMCLZP/Tinker/LZPT/LZPTC/default.aspx to determine if there are FMS subscribers. When\nonly FMS subscribers to a TO remain, set the TO status to FMS Only.\n\n4.4.3 CD-ROMs/DVDs. If a single TO or multiple TOs will be distributed on a CD-ROM or DVD, the TOMA must\nestablish a speci\ufb01c TO Number for the CD ROM or DVD distributed. These actions will ensure that users will be able to\nsubscribe to the CD-ROM/DVD TO or collection of TOs.\n\n4.4.3.1\nrequests CD/DVD number and supersede the paper TO.\n\nIf a single TO distributed on CD/DVD will replace a single paper version (no paper distribution at all), the TOMA\n\n4.4.3.2 For a collection of TOs that are to be distributed on CD/DVD, TOMAs will add TO collection to CD/DVD on\nManage TO Detail screen in ETIMS. (See FUG https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531). If the CD/DVD distribution will be for an\nIETM/S1000D based TO, a Catalog Note will be included listing the TO groups contained on the CD/DVD (IETM/S1000D)\nand indicate the viewing application or system required. The TO Number printed on the CD will be the same as the TO\nIndex. Individual TOs contained in the collection that are not available for distribution separately as paper shall be indexed\nas -WA-1, if available through ETIMS. TO Manager shall associate all TOs in collection on CD/DVD Manager Tech Order\nDetail page.\n\n4.4.3.3 If TOs for multiple systems or commodities are included on the CD/DVD, use a disk TO number which will help\nidentify all of the systems/commodities. (See the instructions for establishing a TCTO Series Header Number in TO 00-5-\n18.)\n\n4.4.3.4 If multiple TO types are included (e.g., a disk containing operations, maintenance and inspection TOs), either use\nthe lowest TO type dash (-) number contained on the disk or omit the TO type designator altogether in the CD/DVD TO\nnumber.\n\n4.4.3.5 Numbering Multiple Disks in a Set. If a TO is published in volumes or a TO set is too large for a single disk, the\n\u2019n\u2019 will indicate the volume/disk number. If a TO Set has varying classi\ufb01cations, or a supplemental TO has been published,\nthe \u2019n\u2019 can differentiate between differently classi\ufb01ed disks. See examples, TO 00-5-18.\n\n4.4.3.6 TO Distribution Media Suffix Codes. Media suffixes will only be used when indexing and subscribing to\nversions of the TO, they will NOT appear on the TO title page. TO Numbers assigned to CD-ROM or DVD disks used for\nthe distribution of single or multiple digital TOs shall re\ufb02ect the TO number including the media suffix on the disk and case\nlabels (Paragraph 4.1.6.2).\n\n4.4.4 eTOs. Digital TOs distributed electronically for use are known as eTOs. The distribution of eTOs is critically\ndependent upon the capability to publish updates in a timeframe that meets interim TO (ITO) requirements. An eTO\nnumbering request will be given a standard TO number to include a -WA-1 suffix on the end of an existing or new TO\nnumber in the ETIMS Catalog. Non-ETIMS eTOs will be numbered ending in the -WA-2 suffix (waiver required except for\nIETM/S1000D based TOs, Nuclear Weapon Center TOs and classi\ufb01ed TOs). The TOMA will create a new index record in\nETIMS. These actions will ensure that users will be able to subscribe to the eTO and that one-time requisition for the eTO\nwill not be processed.

Checklists are posted on the Air Force Technical Order Managers SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.\n\nNOTE\n\nAll digital \ufb01le media (-WA-n), are indexed as revisions with a publication date matching the latest paper TO\nincrement (Revision, Change, or Supplement). The entire index history for the paper version should not be\nduplicated for the eTO version.\n\n4.4.5 Numbering and Indexing Supplemental TO Manuals and Parent TOs. When a Supplemental Manual (see TO\n00-5-1) is published as a child to a parent TO, both publications must have a supplement notice on the title pages when one\ncannot be used without the other. Use statement INCOMPLETE WITHOUT TO XX-XX-XX. The same statement will also\nbe placed in the ETIMS Catalog Notes for both TOs.\n\n4.4.6 Distributing Marked-up Changes during System Modi\ufb01cations. TOMAs issue a waiver, with the written agree-\nment of the lead commands and MAJCOMs, to use veri\ufb01ed preliminary changes (red-line, marked-up, or clean copies) for\nrequired modi\ufb01cation programs such as data used to support maintenance on a TCTO-modi\ufb01ed system until the related TO\nchanges are formally published. Authorized use of red-lined or marked-up TOs shall not exceed 180 days unless Lead\nCommand authorization is updated.

Procedures to manage and control\npreliminary changes will rest with the local using organization.\n\n4.4.7 Interim TOs (ITOs). Index ITOs using a PSN with media code P (Printed Copy). Interim TOs cannot be requisi-\ntioned and must be locally printed. TOMA will send noti\ufb01cation using ETIMS when ITO is deployed with instruction to\ndownload.\n\n4.4.8 Preliminary Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs).

If paper TCTO \ufb01les are distributed on CD/DVD, number and index the TCTO as\nTCTO Series-CD (or DV)-1-501 (or higher).\n\n4.4.10 Supplements. The TOMA indexes a new TO supplement by using the ETIMS Manager Tech Order Detail screen\nand selecting the Add Supp in the Actions column. Supplement sequence numbers are assigned automatically in ETIMS and\nrestart at 1 (or C depending on type of supplement) after each TO revision. The new supplement is then distributed IAW TO\n00-5-1 and this TO. (Refer to FUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).\n\n4.4.10.1 If a supplement is indexed incorrectly (not as a revision), an FSC ticket will be required to delete the incorrect\nincrement and the TOMA will then index the revision.\n\n4.4.10.2 FMP Supplements. FMP supplements have sequential supplement numbering for the life of the manual. ETIMS\nwill continue the numbering process on FMP Supplements with any new revision.\n\n4.4.11 Supplements Affecting Digital TOs.\n\n4.4.11.1 Publication of formal TO supplements is incompatible with a digital-only TO publication and distribution pro-\ncess, and they shall not be used for HTML eTOs. However, if the publication of a formal TO Supplement is required to\nsupport paper distribution of a TO, number and index the stand-alone supplement as a paper document (TO Number + S-n\nor SS-n with a PSN ending in 06). The formal supplements for PDF eTOs or CD-ROM/DVD TOs will be merged into the\ndigital TO \ufb01le prior to issue. The TO media (-WA-1, -CD-1, or -DV-1) will be indexed as a Revision with a PSN ending in\n11, and will be dated the same as the paper supplement. Do NOT index an eTO supplement as a stand-alone \ufb01le with\nthe -WA-1 media distribution code, as this will prevent loading either \ufb01le to the ETIMS repository.\n\n4.4.11.2 Paper interim supplements will be indexed in ETIMS by selecting Local Print, which ETIMS will automatically\nselect the interim indicator and assign a PSN ending in P (Printed Copy, used for messages which have to be printed locally).\nInterim supplements to digital PDF eTOs will be merged into (posted to) the digital eTO prior to uploading to ETIMS. Refer\nto TOMA SharePoint site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531) for speci\ufb01c details. The merged TO \ufb01le will be indexed as a\nRevision with a PSN ending in 11, with a publication date that matches the paper supplement date. HTML eTOs must use\nRACs instead of interim supplements.\n\n4.4.12 Interim eTCTO Supplements. Supplements must be merged into digital PDF TO \ufb01les and posted IAW TO 00-5-1\nand fully linked and annotated by the TOMA before uploading to ETIMS for viewing and distribution. This includes a title\npage note referencing the supplement as well as hyperlinks to affected paragraphs. Refer to the FUG on the TOMA\nSharePoint site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531) for speci\ufb01c details.\n\n4.5 TECHNICAL ORDER RESCISSIONS.\n\nRescind TOs when all media types will be deleted without replacement. Rescind single media type of TO only if FMS/SAP\nis not on subscription in SATODS. Rescind TCTOs/eTCTOs when rescission dates are reached IAW TO 00-5-15, or the\nTCTOs/eTCTOs are no longer required. Extend rescission dates on TCTOs/eTCTOs when required IAW TO 00-5-15.\n\n4-22\n",

For rescission of supplements to digital data, see Paragraph 4.1.4.2.3.2.\n\nNOTE\n\nTOs and increments replaced by or combined into new TOs and TO updates will be superseded not rescinded.\n\n4.5.1 TCM Procedures. The TCM will perform the following actions before recommending rescission of a TO without\nreplacement, whether the need for rescission is identi\ufb01ed through \ufb01eld inputs or through a periodic post-publication review.\nRescind TCTO IAW TO 00-5-15.\n\n4.5.1.1 Notify the TOMA of any proposed TO rescission of digital/paper/or both with the following information as a\nminimum: TO number, known operational systems, commodities and related TOs involved, part number, type/model and\nseries of items, associated weapon system (and active/retired status), and also include any replacing data.\n\n4.5.1.2 If provided by the TOMA, evaluate subscriber\u2019s justi\ufb01cation to retain the TO. As required, contact subscribers\nrequesting retention for additional information or clari\ufb01cation. Advise TOMA to retain or rescind the TO.\n\n4.5.1.3 Ensure the system or commodities affected have been removed from operation and phased out of the inventory by\nchecking the Standard Reporting Designator (SRD) through REMIS.\n\n4.5.2 TOMA Procedures.\n\n4.5.3 The TOMA will perform the following actions prior to rescission of a TO without replacement.\n\n4.5.3.1 Use the ETIMS Notify Subscribers Screen to advise all affected users and managers (TODOs, PMs, FMS (SATOP\nOffice), etc.) of the proposed rescission. If the TO is joint-service, follow AFI 20-118 procedures to notify other DoD\nactivities. Include all of the information provided by the TCM in the noti\ufb01cation message. Request detailed justi\ufb01cation be\nprovided by any subscriber who opposes the rescission. Include a pending rescission date in the noti\ufb01cation (not less than 30\ndays from the noti\ufb01cation date).\n\n4.5.3.2 If upon the pending rescission date, no subscribers have provided justi\ufb01cation to retain the TO, the TOMA will use\nthe ETIMS Manage TO screen to rescind the TO and update the ETIMS Catalog. The TO record remains in ETIMS.\n\n4.5.3.3 If detailed justi\ufb01cation to retain the TO is received, provide the justi\ufb01cation and subscriber\u2019s contact information\nto the TCM for evaluation/resolution.\n\n4.5.4 Rescission of Supplements on Digital (-WA-1) only TOs. ETIMS requires a newer date to deploy eTO so the\nfollowing will be required:\n\n4.5.4.1 Remove supplement and current annotations from PDF and annotate on Title Page S-X rescinded DDMMMYY.\n\n4.5.4.2 Upload PDF to ETIMS with rescission date of supplement.\n\n4.5.4.3 Index revision in ETIMS where pub date is rescission date of supplement and add catalog note stated S-X\nrescinded DDMMMYY.\n\n4.5.5 Rescission of Single Media Type. This procedure is accomplished when only one media type requires rescission\nfor USAF but is used by FMS/SAP. Prior to the rescission of one media, it must be determined if the TO is used by\nFMS/SAP. If the TO is used for FMS/SAP, set TO status in ETIMS to FMS Only.\n\n4.5.6 Nuclear Weapons TOs. Send rescission requests for nuclear TOs to the AFNWC/NCL Technical Support Flight,\n2000 Wyoming Blvd SE, Kirtland AFB NM, 87117-5617.\n\n4.5.7 Joint Service to Retention. If joint-service-use TOs are still required by another service, transfer TO management,\nreproduction masters, and warehouse stocks to that service. (See AFI 20-118).\n\n4-23\n",

Supersede\nTCTOs when replaced by a new TCTO.\n\nNOTE\n\nAdd a Catalog Note in ETIMS, to the record of any superseded TO that is replaced by a different TO, use the\nstatement: Replaced by TO XXX-XXX-XX. Add a matching Catalog Note to the replacement TO record, use the\nstatement: Formerly TO XXX-XXX-XX or Includes TOs XXX-XXX-XX.\n\n4.6.2 Supersedure Notices. Unless otherwise speci\ufb01ed, the supersedure notices shall be placed on the title page when\nthe manual/change/revision/RAC under preparation supersedes all or portions of other manuals/changes/revisions. When\nspeci\ufb01ed, the supersedure notice shall include a list of all currently superseded supplements and RACs IAW MIL-STD-\n38784. No supersedure notice is required when PTOs are superseded. Provide any special instructions in the change package\n(e.g., the list of TO increments to be listed in the title page supersedure notice).\n\nExamples:\n\n\u2022 When an SH252 is being incorporated\n\ninto a new increment, the SH252 Project\nNumber and date must be listed on the\ntitle page supersedure notice of the new\nincrement. Example: THIS PUBLICA-\nTION SUPERSEDES SPECIAL HAN-\nDLING AFTO FORM 252 PROJECT\nNO. 51Mxxxxxxxxxxxx, DATED 20\nJULY 2011.\n\n\u2022 When an IOS/ISS is being incorporated\ninto a change, the IOS must be listed on\nthe title page supersedure notice of the\nnew increment. Example: THIS PUBLI-\nCATION SUPERSEDES TO 00-5-3S-1,\nDATED 12 FEBRUARY 2010.\n\n4.6.3 TO Disposition. The TOMA will supersede or rescind TOs when they have been replaced or are no longer required,\nIAW this TO. TOs will be retained in the Archives until six years after the equipment supported leaves the inventory\n(reference Paragraph 5.7, Archive Procedures).\n\n4.7 REACTIVATE TECHNICAL ORDERS.\n\nTOMA changes TO status from rescinded to active using the Manager Tech Order Detail screens IAW the ETIMS\nFUG (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).\n\n4.8 TRANSFER OF TECHNICAL ORDER MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY.\n\n4.8.1 Business Practices. Responsibility for TO program and content management transfers to the new ETIMS propo-\nnent if the system or equipment covered by the TOs is transferred. Both losing and gaining proponents must agree on the\ntransfer and schedules before any actions can occur. Transfer should include all TOs and all TO family increments in the\naffected TO series; i.e., all related basics, changes, supplements, source data, TCTOs and TCTO series headers. TOMA and\nTCM responsibilities must also be transferred within the proponent when the assigned personnel transfer or otherwise\nbecome inactive.\n\n4-24\n",

This can only be accomplished once research of all legacy\nsystems indicate the TOs belong to the gaining organization. If proponent transfer is still a dispute, AFMC/A4F will make\nthe \ufb01nal determination.\n\nNOTE\n\n4.8.3 Proponent Transfer Procedures. The losing TOMA will identify to the gaining TOMA, TOs to be transferred on\na spreadsheet (template located at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531). The gaining TOMA completes spreadsheet with propo-\nnent, TO Manager and Equipment Specialist for each TO on spreadsheet. Spreadsheet is provided to local TO Site Func-\ntional Office or AF TOFST (for location with no local site office), who will, in turn, create and submit a Field Support Center\nticket.\n\n4.8.4 Print Ownership Transfer in TODPG. When transfer of TO management responsibilities occur and there are TOs\nresiding in TODPG for printing, the losing and gaining TOMAs have actions to complete.

        "subheader": "TO 00-5-3\n\nCHAPTER 5\nTECHNICAL ORDER REPRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n5.1 TECHNICAL ORDER DISTRIBUTE AND PRINT GATEWAY (TODPG).\n\nTODPG is the AF-directed system used for all printing of physical media TOs (paper, CD/DVD).\n\n5.1.1 TODPG Concept of Operation. TODPG provides the central DLA Data Management Services repository with\nready- for-production (print ready) PDF format TO \ufb01les in support of physical media Initial Distribution (ID) and subsequent\nOne-Time Requisition (OTR) transactions for complete TOs or for speci\ufb01c (active) TO Changes and/or Supplements.\nTODPG is the central point in a DLA Wide Area Network (WAN) connecting DLA Data Management Services production\nsites. TODPG sends ID/OTR print orders through the DLA network for reproduction, packing and shipment by DLA\nDocument Services sites closest to the TODO customer-worldwide.\n\n5.1.1.1 All ID transactions are processed by an interface between ETIMS and TODPG. Once a new physical media\nincrement is made available for index in the ETIMS catalog, jobs are already created in TODPG for Technical Order\nManagers/Agents (TOMAs) to upload content. Once content is loaded, ETIMS is noti\ufb01ed through interface and label\ninformation is sent automatically to TODPG to support ID print and distribution.\n\n5.1.1.2 All OTR transactions are processed by an interface between ETIMS and TODPG. ETIMS TODO-approved OTR\ntransactions are sent directly to TODPG where it is determined if the requisitioned TO has been uploaded to TODPG. If the\nTO has been uploaded and the correct version of the requisitioned TO is available, TODPG will deliver the print job to the\nDLA Data Management Services site closest to the TODO for printing and direct shipment. If the TO has not been uploaded\nto TODPG, or a current version of the requisitioned TO is not uploaded, it will be placed in a held status until it is correctly\nuploaded into TODPG for processing.\n\n5.1.1.3 The following statement is required on the title page of merged master \ufb01les for ALL TOs when incorporating\nprevious increments: BASIC AND ALL UPDATES HAVE BEEN MERGED TO MAKE THIS A COMPLETE PUBLICA-\nTION. The merged master \ufb01le will consist of the basic TO and all active changes and supplements. For reprints and OTR\nsupport, the master \ufb01le is required to be uploaded to TODPG. For digital eTOs, see Paragraph 5.4.5.1.\n\n5.1.1.4 Depending on pro\ufb01le settings, TODPG provides Job Status email noti\ufb01cations.\n\n5.1.1.5 When USAF TOs are totally distributed as eTOs through ETIMS and there are still FMS paper printing distribu-\ntion requirements, funding changes are required to the TODPG system to support the uploading of the digital \ufb01le in support\nof the FMS printing requirement. See Functional Users Guide (FUG) at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531 for instructions.\n\n5.1.1.6 An interface between the Security Assistance TO Data System (SATODS) and TODPG will manage the printing\nand distribution of AF TOs directly to responsible freight forwarders when FMS customers are on subscription for Air Force\nTOs uploaded on TODPG.\n\n5.1.1.7 Security Assistance Technical Order Program (SATOP) has assumed distribution responsibility of AF TOs to\nauthorized FMS accounts.\n\n5.1.2 Funding for Sustainment of TOs and TODPG Operations. TO Managers must identify printing, packing and\nshipping costs. TO sustainment funding requirements will be documented via the Comprehensive Air Force Technical Order\nPlan (CAFTOP), TO Information Sheet (TOIS) and Centralized Asset Management (CAM) processes.\n\n5.1.2.1 TO Managers must establish fund cites in TODPG for reimbursement of funds to DLA Data Management Services\nfor the printing, packing and shipping costs as applicable on all ID, OTRs and complete merged set uploads.\n\n5.1.2.2 TODPG provides the capability to enter more than one fund cite per weapon system program, i.e., TODPG will\nsupport separate fund cites required for sustainment reproduction, modi\ufb01cation production, TO packing and shipment.\nTODPG also allows the user to annotate a split percentage from a fund cite for a speci\ufb01c job. Example: A percentage from\na sustainment fund cite and a percentage from a modi\ufb01cation fund cite may be used for any single job to total 100% funding.\nSee FUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.\n\n5-1\n",

Urgent must be published and distributed within 40 calendar days.\n\nNOTE\n\nBoth the ID and merged jobs have to be at content loaded status in TODPG before ETIMS will set the Available\nfor Distribution \ufb02ags to yes and generate ID labels.\n\n5.1.4.2 Mandatory Uploads of Complete Merged TOs & TCTOs. Once a single TO/TCTO has been made available\nfor index in ETIMS or an interim supplement has been distributed digitally, a merged copy of the TO must be uploaded to\nTODPG.\n\n5-2\n",

This spreadsheet shall be provided\nto DLA 30 days prior to the job being submitted. If projected submittal date is delayed, FMM/TO Manager shall notify DLA\nof new projected submittal date. If the order has not been submitted by projected submittal date and DLA is not noti\ufb01ed of\ndelay, DLA is permitted to use the supplies for other jobs. If this happens, FMM/TO Manager may experience delay in\ncompletion of concurrent release if additional supplies are required when job is submitted.

DLA Data\nManagement Services manages all TO printing and reproduction requirements for the Air Force IAW DoDI 5330.03,\nDefense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services.\n\n5.3 TECHNICAL ORDER DISTRIBUTION PRACTICES.\n\n5.3.1 Preliminary TOs (PTOs). PTOs are distributed by a contractor or other developing activity to support IPRs,\nveri\ufb01cation, and prepublication reviews IAW the tables in Section 2 of the TMCR. Distribution is limited to the acquisition/\nreview participants. Distribution of PTOs for Test and Evaluation (T&E) or operational use is controlled by the TOMA IAW\nAFI 63-101/20-101. PTOs are not distributed via ETIMS for viewing.\n\n5.3.2 Operational Use PTOs. Using organizations may use preliminary data for hands-on training, operations, or main-\ntenance when veri\ufb01ed and authorized by the PM or representative along with concurrence from the Lead Command or\nDepot. Authorization for the use of preliminary data shall not exceed 180 days unless readdressed. The authorization\nmemorandum must accompany the data at all times. The TOMA will arrange for printing, storage and distribution of PTOs\napproved for use in the operational environment IAW this TO. For major acquisition or modi\ufb01cation programs, the prime\ncontract may cover PTO storage and issue. Each page of the PTO will contain a watermark stating that the PTO is not for\n\ufb01eld use.\n\n5.3.3 Formal TOs. Formal paper and CD-ROM/DVD TOs are distributed IAW TO 00-5-1 and Paragraph 5.5. Formal\neTOs are distributed via ETIMS (Paragraph 5.5.1) unless program has an AFMC/A4 approved waiver.\n\n5.3.4 Restrictions. Distribution of both formal and preliminary TOs may be restricted to government agencies, govern-\nment contractors, or as otherwise speci\ufb01ed by the TOMA and TCM (Chapter 3).\n\n5.3.5 TO Shipments. All package service or USPS shipments shall use tear-resistant, secure envelopes for TO packages\nweighing less than \ufb01ve pounds. TOs boxed for shipment will be secured using strapping tape or bands.\n\n5.3.6 Manage Outside Agency Requests for Air Force TOs. Process requisitions from other U.S. government agen-\ncies, contractors and civilians IAW TO 00-5-1 and AFI 20-118. Process Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for TO\ndata strictly IAW DoDM 5400.07, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, DODD 5230.25, Withholding of Unclassi\ufb01ed\nTechnical Data From Public Disclosure, this TO and TO 00-5-1.\n\n5.3.6.1 TOs with Distribution Limitation codes B through F may be exempt from release under FOIA, IAW DoDD\n5230.25, DoDM 5400.07, and AFI 61-201 .\n\n5.3.6.2 Requests for TOs from activities or individuals outside the limitations speci\ufb01ed by the assigned Distribution\nStatement must be approved by the DoD Controlling Office (responsible TOMA and TCM). If the responsible office cannot\nbe identi\ufb01ed, refer requests for TO release to HQ AFMC/A4F, email: afmc.a4.af.topp@us.af.mil, to determine the proper\nrelease authority.\n\n5.3.6.3 If the TO or other technical data is not marked, it will be handled as STINFO Distribution Statement F, and will be\nreferred to the responsible TCM for assignment of an appropriate Distribution Statement prior to being issued.\n\n5.4 PUBLISHING ELECTRONIC TECHNICAL ORDERS.\n\n5.4.1 Ensure Con\ufb01guration Control of Multi-Media TOs. When TOs are published in more than one medium (e.g.,\npaper and WA-1), information about the con\ufb01guration of the TO (TO Catalog data) and all media formats must re\ufb02ect the\nsame content con\ufb01guration. The digital online (-WA-1) version, after optimization, shall be uploaded to ETIMS, and de-\nployed when other media types are submitted to TODPG for reproduction. This ensures eTOs are deployed at same time or\nbefore other media. EXCEPTION: Flight manual and/or checklist distribution of electronic media type may not be concur-\nrent with the paper media type. See AFI 11-215 for further guidance.\n\n5.4.2 Transition to Electronic TOs. The AF CTOM/MAJCOM representative responsible for coordinating transition to\ndigital only distribution shall assess eTool deployment status at their operational locations to ensure effective eTool programs\nare in place. When the MAJCOM operational locations have effective eTool programs, they will notify their TODOs to\nremove paper ID. The TOMA will send an ETIMS noti\ufb01cation (or email) to the TODOs 30 days prior to rescinding a paper\n\n5-4\n",

The TOMA must index the required increment and mark Available for Index,\nupload, validate and deploy an optimized eTO using the ETIMS program. For speci\ufb01c procedures, refer to the FUG on the\nTOMA SharePoint https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.\n\n5.4.5 Publishing eTO Updates. The eTO version of a TO also available in paper is published by issuing the TO \ufb01le with\nall changes and supplements merged into a single document \ufb01le.

Managing TO supplements is\nincompatible with digital publication and distribution processes.\n\n5.4.5.3 WA-2 eTOs. WA-2 eTOs are eTO versions not accessible through ETIMS. TO Details page will indicate the\nlocation of the complete eTO \ufb01le. These eTO updates are often published using proprietary publishing capability. TOMAs\nmust take steps to ensure only current and complete eTOs are available for viewing or distribution. NOTE: A waiver is\nrequired to distributed WA-2 eTOs outside of ETIMS. See Paragraph 4.3.11.3.\n\n5.4.6 CD/DVD Media. CD/DVD media will only be used as a distribution method in situations when ETIMS cannot\nprovide electronic TO distribution. Once electronic distribution can be provided, the CD/DVD will be rescinded using the\nsame process as paper in Paragraph 5.4.2.\n\n5.4.6.1 CD-ROM/DVD Contents.

The content of TOs on a CD-ROM/DVD must be identical to that\nof the individual (stand-alone) paper TOs. The TCM for the CD/DVD, in coordination with the TOMA and MAJCOM, is\nresponsible for determining which TO \ufb01les will be included on the CD/DVD (Paragraph 4.1.6.1). Classi\ufb01ed and unclassi\ufb01ed\nTOs will not be mixed on a single CD. The TOMA will determine routine update intervals, in conjunction with the Lead\nCommand, and the TCMs of the TOs included on the CD/DVD.\n\n5.4.6.2 Grouping TOs on CD/DVD Media. Groupings shall be made logically (e.g., by TO category, series, sub-system,\nsubject, distribution limitation, classi\ufb01cation, etc.) by the TCM, with the concurrence of the Using/Lead Command. The\nTCM must revise the CD or DVD whenever any TOs on the disk are updated, and must re-associate the included TOs with\nthe CD/DVD TO number.\n\n5.5 ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION OF TECHNICAL ORDERS.\n\nThe below paragraphs outline the authorized methods and procedures for disseminating Controlled Unclassi\ufb01ed Information\n(CUI), applicable for any technical data (including Technical Orders, Technical Reports, Test Data, etc.) with STINFO\ndistribution statements B through F. Reference publications include DoDI 5230.24 and DoDD 5230.25; AFI 63-101, AFI\n17\u2013130, Cybersecurity Program Management, Air Force Systems Security Instruction (AFSSI) 8520, Identi\ufb01cation and\nAuthentication, and AFI 61-201.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe AF TO Field Support Team (AF TOFST) has developed TOMA Checklists to assist with ETIMS standard\nTO/eTO indexing, eTO mass indexing, and WA-2 and WA-1 conversion. Use of the checklists is CRITICAL for\nsuccessful accomplishment of TOMAs duties. Checklists are posted on the Air Force Technical Order Manager\nSharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. TOMA Checklists are under Document Management.\n\n5.5.1 Distribution Using ETIMS (eTOs). ETIMS is the official method for distribution of Air Force eTOs; use of any\nother method on a program-wide basis will require a written, WA-2 waiver IAW Paragraph 4.3.11.3.\n\n5.5.1.1 TOMAs access GCSS-AF eTO Services\u2019 eTO Repository to upload eTOs and updates for electronic distribution.\nTOMAs and their support organizations will need stylesheets, ArborText Editor and CPS software to transform SGML-\ntagged TO \ufb01les to HTML eTOs for publishing on the ETIMS Repository. When uploading PDF eTO \ufb01les, \ufb01lenames shall\nconsist of the paper TO number with a .PDF extension (e.g., eTO 00-5-3-WA-1 would be 00-5-3 .PDF). This \ufb01lename\nremains static during subsequent update by the TOMA in support of external linking to eTOs within and outside of their\nmanagement control.

If any eTO \ufb01les are larger than 128 MB that are to be\nloaded into ETIMS, it is highly recommended to section the TO into two or more volumes. TOs may be broken out by\nchapters or other logical divisions as necessary, and each volume must have its own title page, TO number, LEP and Table\nof Contents; title pages must have this statement: This TO is not complete without TO ###; and the volumes must be indexed\nin ETIMS as-WA-1 for upload to ETIMS. This requirement is in addition to the rules for multivolume manuals in MIL-\nSTD-38784. See TO 00-5-18 for numbering rules.\n\nNOTE\n\nTOMAs will ensure their authoring entity optimize TO \ufb01les by using the fast web view Adobe function prior to\nupload into the ETIMS repository. The same optimized version of the \ufb01le will be used for printing.\n\n5.5.1.3 Other eTO Distribution Systems. Consult local procedures for uploading eTOs (non-AF HTML or PDF \ufb01les\nwith a -WA-2 suffix) to other repositories for eTO viewing and distribution operations. Access or distribution of eTOs\navailable or hosted by systems other than ETIMS is dependent upon each system\u2019s design for access or distribution. TODOs\nwith subscriptions for these eTOs must independently establish access to these systems.\n\n5.5.2 PDF eTOs with Paper Distribution. If a PDF version of a TO will be distributed both in paper and electronically,\nthe same .PDF \ufb01le will be used to support both methods.\n\n5.5.2.1 A copy of the .PDF TO or TO update \ufb01le will be indexed in ETIMS and uploaded to TODPG for printing paper\nand Initial Distribution. Then the TO \ufb01le and any update \ufb01les will be merged to make a complete, current TO for follow-on\nPrint-On-Demand (POD) through TODPG.\n\n5.5.2.2 For distribution as an eTO, the merged PDF TO \ufb01le will be indexed as a revision having a -WA-n suffix and with\nthe same date as the latest update. It will then be uploaded to ETIMS for distribution and viewing.\n\n5.5.2.3 Interim (Local Print) TOs are not uploaded to TODPG for distribution. ETIMS eTO will be used to support TODO\nlocal print requirements.\n\n5.5.3 HTML/XML eTOs with Paper Distribution. HTML/XML TOs can only be updated by revisions, changes or RACs.\nSupplements cannot be used with HTML/XML format. If paper is required, the same source SGML \ufb01le that created the\nHTML/XML TO is used to create Adobe PDF \ufb01le for TODPG printing and ID. After ID is complete, the PDF TO \ufb01le and\nany PDF update \ufb01les will be merged into a complete current TO for follow-on OTRs. The HTML TO \ufb01le is updated with all\nchanges and regenerated from the source SGML. The transformed \ufb01les can be viewed using the AF eTO Viewer in ETIMS\nor eTools.\n\nNOTE\n\nDistribution of ITOs using email shall be limited to instances where no ETIMS version of eTO exists. A noti\ufb01-\ncation shall be sent using ETIMS to ensure all subscribed TODOs are aware of emailed TOs.\n\n5.5.4 Distribution Using Email. There are two levels of email available to most TO system users:\n\n\u2022 Medium Grade Service using Microsoft Outlook and a CAC on the NIPRNet to digitally sign and encrypt Con-\ntrolled Unclassi\ufb01ed Information (CUI), restricted distribution messages, and a SIPRNet Account for transmitting\nclassi\ufb01ed messages.\n\n\u2022 Unsigned, unencrypted Outlook (or other Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) programs) for publicly releasable\n\nmessages (distribution statement A).\n\n5-7\n",

Classi\ufb01ed information must be sent over the Secure Internet Protocol\nRouter Network (SIPRNet) which requires username and password access. Both sender and recipients must have their CAC\ncerti\ufb01cates properly registered in order to sign and encrypt/decrypt messages. Refer to the Setting Up and Using PKI for End\nUsers training page on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) web site at https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/html/. For Organizational\nAccounts, (Paragraph 5.5.4.6).\n\nNOTE\n\n\u2022 There is an alternative practice for use by Certi\ufb01ed U.S. Contractors not authorized CACs. They can request a\nDoD-approved External Certi\ufb01cate Authorization (ECA) issued by Verisign, Digital Signatures Trust (DST), or\nOperational Research Consultants (ORC). Refer to the ECA web site at http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/.\n\n\u2022 Prime contractors and vendors may not have access to signed, encrypted email if they do not have .mil access,\nnor will FMS customers have access. A copy of AF ITOs will be sent to TinkerSatopInterim@us.af.mil for\ndistribution by SATOP.\n\n\u2022 Ensure all recipients on address lists are authorized access to the data being transmitted. Do not send CUI to\norganization addresses which go to all or most of the organization. A TODO email address is authorized for\nuse. Reverify address lists as often as practical but at least annually.\n\n5.5.4.2 Secure Distribution via Email. This policy applies to all methods used for email, including BlackBerry and other\nhandheld devices, Outlook Web Access, and remote email via Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Remote Procedure Call\n(RPC) over secure hypertext transfer protocol.\n\nNOTE\n\n\u2022 For security reasons, unsigned, unencrypted Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email can only be used for\ntransmitting distribution A (public release) Interim TOs, RACs or ITCTOs. Any Outlook messages containing\nrestricted-distribution data (codes B-F) must be digitally signed and encrypted using a CAC or External Certi-\n\ufb01cation Authority (ECA) certi\ufb01cates.\n\n\u2022 Personnel who do not have certi\ufb01cates published to the Global Address List (GAL) may have to exchange\nemails to get their certi\ufb01cates recognized. Public key certi\ufb01cates for DoD personnel can be obtained at DoD\nGlobal Directory Services (GDS) web site https://dod411.gds.disa.mil/ (.mil domain and CAC required).\n\n5.5.4.3 Use the Sign and Encrypt icons in Outlook (envelope with a red seal and envelope with a lock superimposed), to\nsecure messages before they are sent. See the Help function in Outlook for more information. To ensure receipt by the\naddressees, ask for an S/MIME Receipt (Outlook Tools/Options/Security).\n\nNOTE\n\nRecipients must have current, valid, registered CAC certi\ufb01cates.\n\n5.5.4.4 Digitally Signing Emails. Digital signatures shall be used whenever it is necessary for the recipient to be assured\nof the sender\u2019s identity, have con\ufb01dence the email message has not been modi\ufb01ed, or when non-repudiation is required.\nExamples include formal direction to a government employee or contractor, messages that stipulate an Air Force official\nposition on any matter, and messages committing, authorizing or denying funding in some manner. Do not sign messages\ncontaining only unofficial information and not containing an embedded hyperlink and/or attachment.\n\n5.5.4.5 Encrypting Email. Emails shall be encrypted when they contain For Official Use Only (FOUO) information;\nPrivacy Act Information; Personally Identi\ufb01able Information (PII); individually identi\ufb01able health information, DoD payroll,\n\ufb01nance, logistics, personnel management, proprietary and foreign government information; contract data; export controlled\ntechnical data or information; and operational information regarding status, readiness, location, or operational use of forces\nor equipment. Encryption increases bandwidth and resource requirements; therefore, email encryption should be used to\nprotect only the above types of information, and the number of email recipients should be kept to a minimum. (This includes\ntechnical data with STINFO codes B through F) DoD PKI-based encryption is not authorized for protection of classi\ufb01ed\ninformation on non-secure systems, such as the Non-classi\ufb01ed Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET).\n\n5.5.4.5.1 Each major AF installation has a service delivery point through which all email traffic (both in- and out-going)\nis funneled.

US Government TODOs (i.e., F* accounts) are\nrequired to associate an organizational email account with their TODO account. For TOs containing public releasable\ncontent, TOMAs may augment ETIMS distribution (Paragraph 5.5.1) of urgent TO updates by exchanging emails with these\nTODO accounts. For TOs containing controlled, unclassi\ufb01ed content, TOMAs shall send noti\ufb01cation through ETIMS and\nmay augment with an email noti\ufb01cation to TODOs for urgent TO updates. TOMAs can upload the content to internet sites\nwith appropriate access controls.\n\n5.5.5 Distribution Using the Internet.\n\n5.5.5.1 Non-ETIMS Sites. Use of such sites instead of ETIMS requires a WA-2 waiver from AFMC/A4F IAW Paragraph\n1.2.1, https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12837/default.aspx. TO listings on host servers will include the TO Number, Date, Title, and\nChange Number/Date to allow users to verify con\ufb01guration of downloaded copies without opening or downloading the \ufb01le.\nAdditional information, such as TOMA or TCM information, is optional. Ensure the host server has appropriate access\ncontrols to protect limited distribution TOs and data (AFIs 33-115, 17\u2013130).\n\n5.5.5.2 AF SharePoint Folders. TOMAs may augment the dissemination of restricted distribution TOs via ETIMS\nthrough the use of AF SharePoint folders. TOMAs create restricted TO folders and provide advance access while authorized\nusers set alerts to automatically receive an email when restricted TOs are uploaded. TOMAs shall follow the FUG proce-\ndures at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531 to ensure SharePoint folders are clearly identi\ufb01ed as restricted and access is limited\nto subscribers previously authorized in ETIMS.\n\n5.5.6 Other Distribution Methods. There are several other methods, both electronic and physical, for distributing con-\ntrolled, unclassi\ufb01ed data.\n\n5.5.6.1 Secure facsimile machines (fax) which encrypt the data for transmission may be used.\n\n5.5.6.2 Physical distribution on physical media via USPS mail or U.S. package delivery service is authorized. The data\nmay be printed and mailed using the same delivery methods as physical media or paper TOs (references: AFI 16-1404, TOs\n00-5-1, and 00-5-19.\n\n5.5.6.3 In all cases, the sender must verify the address by checking the Master Address Report (MAD) in ETIMS and\nensure the recipient is authorized access to the data being sent. The authorizations must be reveri\ufb01ed as often as practical but\nat least annually.\n\n5.6 ERRATA SHEETS.\n\nTOs and TO increments distributed with missing or misprinted pages may be corrected by redistributing the missing/\nreprinted pages using an Errata cover sheet and ETIMS Errata Process. Refer to FUG on https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.\nThe Errata Cover Sheet (see Glossary) will provide instructions to insert/replace the pages into the affected TOs and how to\ndocument receipt in ETIMS.

The acquisition agency System Safety or Ground Safety (SEG), BEE (or equivalent), Fire\nSafety and Environmental Management (or equivalent) Offices are responsible for supporting TO reviews during the acqui-\nsition process. When the acquisition agency is at Product Center coordination with the Air Logistics Complex counterparts is\nessential. System Safety and/or SEG personnel are the SMEs for electrical, mechanical, chemical, radiation, and laser\nhazards. BEE and EM personnel review TOs for personnel hazards and hazardous material (HAZMAT)/Ozone Depleting\nSubstance (ODS) usage and hazardous waste risk. The Fire Safety Office will review any procedures involving \ufb01re protec-\ntion matters such as exposure to heat and \ufb01re.\n\n6.4.2 TO Procedures. TO procedures shall be developed to protect equipment from abuse, inadvertent operation, or any\ncondition which could cause damage or degradation. However, the TO must not become a work-around for hazardous\nequipment design.\n\n6.4.3 Electrostatic Discharge Sensitive (ESDS) Devices.

If Class I ODS must be used, the PM must obtain a waiver\nfrom HQ USAF for ODS use. By international agreement, all Class I ODS production effectively ended on 31 December\n1995 and Class II ODS production shall incrementally decrease and cease by 2030. Dependence on Class II ODS usage\nbeyond the year 2015 will create potentially increasing risks to Air Force mission capability and costs.

Chapter 4 and Chapter 16 of AFI 91-202 list OPRs and\nprocedures for speci\ufb01c types of TOs. These OPRs will identify the appropriate safety offices. Flight Safety and three major\nareas of weapon safety (explosive, nuclear and missile) must be addressed for any military system.\n\n6.6.1 Flight Safety. Flight safety reviews for FMP TOs are the responsibility of the FMM. The TOMA is responsible for\nensuring contractor compliance with direction. Cargo aircraft loading manuals which deal with explosives or nuclear weap-\nons and weapon loading and delivery manuals must receive required explosive and/or nuclear safety reviews as well as \ufb02ight\nsafety reviews.\n\n6.6.2 Explosive Safety Requirements. Basic TOs and all updates containing procedures on the operation, maintenance,\ninspection, modi\ufb01cation, disposal, etc. of aircraft systems, ammunition, missiles (strategic or tactical), missile motors,\nexplosives, egress systems, armament items (such as guns, launchers, dispensers, pods, etc.), and handling, support or test\nequipment peculiar to these items must receive a weapons safety review by the Appropriate Weapons Safety Office. All TO\nprocedures involving explosives must comply with AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards. EXCEPTIONS: The\nGACP, AFLCMC/EBHMA, has safety review responsibility for TOs prime at Hill AFB.

Joint Nuclear Weapons Publications are archived by DTRA Albuquerque\nNM Office (AO).\n\n7.8 SECURITY ASSISTANCE TECHNICAL ORDER PROGRAM.\n\nFMS related nuclear TOs, identi\ufb01ed in TO 0-1-11N-1-CD-1, are not covered under TO 00-5-19, SATOP Program but are\nmanaged by AFNWC through SAF/IA. These types of TOs should be identi\ufb01ed during the NCIS process or early in the\nProgram planning.\n\n7.9 ENVIRONMENTAL, SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH.\n\nThe Program Office will ensure ESOH is complied with by contractors or organic agencies providing source data through an\nevaluation process or certi\ufb01cation letter from the provider of source data as requested by the TOMA/TCM.\n\n7.10 TECHNICAL ORDER CHANGE PROCESSING.\n\nRecommended changes must follow a manual process through encrypted email, secure SharePoint sites, or USPS mail.\nThere are currently no AFNWC managed IETM/S1000D based TOs.\n\n7.10.1 Recommended Changes During Acquisition. Changes during acquisition must be worked closely with the\napplicable AFNWC TOMA to assure Nuclear Certi\ufb01cation impacts are addressed. Early involvement in the TO acquisition\nprocess will ensure changes can be addressed at the appropriate time and manner to prevent \ufb01elding delays.\n\n7.10.2 Recommended Changes During Sustainment. Changes will be processed through the submitter\u2019s Product\nImprovement Manager (PIM), the MAJCOM, who will submit it to the TOMA, or as directed by the TOMA, for processing.\n\n7.10.3 Recommended Changes for JNWPS TOs. Joint Nuclear Weapons Publications recommended changes and\nprocesses are managed as identi\ufb01ed in TO 11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports (URs). URs are processed through DIAMONDS.\nIf you do not have access to a DIAMONDS terminal, contact AFNWC/NCLL work\ufb02ow and they can help you process\nrecommended changes. AFNWC/NCLL is the Air Force JNWPS Executive Agent to provide the interface between DOE and\nthe Air Force for JNWPS TOs. It is important to note that JNWPS TOs do not follow the same criteria as AF TOs for\nassigning Routine, Urgent, and Emergency de\ufb01ciencies. (Reference TO 11N-5-1).\n\n7.11 SOURCE DATA.\n\nContractors or Program Offices, if organically developed, will provide written certi\ufb01cation that all source data meets RGL,\nbio-environmental, and general safety requirements previously identi\ufb01ed in this TO and are ready to be added to the nuclear\noperational technical orders, unless there is another process in place to validate those requirements. This will be part of the\nsource data package or PTOs when delivered to AFNWC for TO updates or veri\ufb01cation of PTOs. (Must meet Paragraph\n3.9.5.1 Certi\ufb01cation Requirements).\n\n7.11.1 Nuclear Weapons Delivery Source Data - Weapons Delivery Source Data Package (Aircraft -25, -30\nSeries Technical Orders).\n\n7.11.1.1 Content. Weapons delivery source data consists of a section for nuclear data and sections of aircraft-speci\ufb01c data\nfor each aircraft that will employ the nuclear munitions. The content is described in MIL-DTL-38384, Manuals, Technical\n- Aircraft Nonnuclear/Nuclear Weapon Delivery Procedures.\n\n7.11.1.2 Development. Delivery envelopes for nuclear weapons are normally developed by the Air Force SEEK EAGLE\nOffice (AFSEO) in coordination with information provided by AFNWC and the Program Office (Reference AFI 63-104).\n\n7.11.1.3 Procedures and Responsibilities. Nuclear procedures will be developed by the program office in coordination\nwith AFNWC/NC to ensure nuclear surety and safety is met.\n\n7.11.1.3.1 Flight Manuals will be developed by the contractor or organic agency as described in MIL-DTL-38384 and are\npart of the nuclear certi\ufb01cation process administered by AFNWC/NC.\n\n7-3\n",
