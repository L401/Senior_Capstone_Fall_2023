1.2 CONCEPT.
Air Force Publications AFPD 63-1/AFPD 20-1, Integrated Life Cycle Management, and AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated
Life Cycle Management, specify TO System policies and instructions. TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System, contains TO
user procedures. This TO covers life-cycle TO management methods and procedures; TO 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compli-
ance Technical Order (TCTO) Process, provides additional management procedures supporting equipment modiﬁcations;
TO 00-5-18, USAF Technical Order Numbering System, provides TO numbering procedures; and TO 00-5-19, Security
Assistance Technical Order Program (SATOP), provides procedures for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs. AFI 11-
215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP), contains policy and procedures unique to ﬂight manuals. AFI 63-125, Nuclear
Certiﬁcation Program, contains policy and procedures for nuclear certiﬁcation systems/equipment.
1.2.1 Policy. Paper and Compact Disc-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM)/Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) TO versions shall be
reproduced and distributed by the Defense Logistics Agency ( DLA) Data Management Services, Technical Order Distribute
and Print Gateway (TODPG), using Print on Demand (POD) for follow-on requisitions. Digital TOs distributed electroni-
cally (eTOs) shall be numbered and indexed with a -WA-1 TO number suffix, and shall be optimized, uploaded and delivered
through the Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS). TO proponent organizations shall use the
Comprehensive Air Force Technical Order Plan (CAFTOP) to plan and schedule compliance with these requirements.
Exemptions and deviations must be authorized by waivers (see waiver procedures and format at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/
12837/default.aspx). All waivers will be submitted to the local TO Site Functional Office per AFMCI 21-301, Air Force
Materiel Command Technical Order System Implementing Policies, who, in turn, will coordinate with the TO Home Office
(AFLCMC/LZSA) and forward to HQ AFMC/A4F for evaluation and ﬁnal disposition. TOs created using S1000D, Type 2
IETMS, and legacy Type 2 non-TMSS speciﬁcations are exempt from distribution to ETIMS until such time as ETIMS
becomes capable of handling these eTOs.
1.2.2 Deﬁnitions.
1.2.2.1 TO Acquisition. (Reference Chapter 3) TO acquisition includes the development and/or procurement of technical
data and TOs to operate and maintain centrally-acquired and managed military systems and commodities. TOs for individual
systems and commodities are acquired by assigned Technical Order Management Agent/Agency (TOMA) (Paragraph 2.1.4).
Flight Manual Managers (FMMs) manage the acquisition of Flight Manual Program (FMP) publications (AFI 11-215) under
the guidance of the TOMA. It also includes acquisition of new TOs and TCTOs to support program modiﬁcations during

sustainment. Acquisition and sustainment of TOs must be effectively managed through the life cycle of the military system
or commodity that the TOs support, as envisioned by the Air Force TO Vision and Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
(https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12837/default.aspx).
1.2.2.2 TO Sustainment. (Reference Chapter 4) TO sustainment refers to all activities required to maintain the currency,
accuracy, and availability of USAF TOs, Country Standard Technical Orders (CSTOs) and M-Symbol TOs in the post-
acquisition phases of a program life cycle. It includes TO updating, verifying, indexing, conﬁguration control, storing,
archiving, distributing, superseding, rescinding, and reactivating. This includes the TOs necessary for, or associated with,
reclamation, re-use, and cannibalization of the system and its associated commodities. Continuing support for FMS custom-
ers is also part of TO sustainment.
1.3 TECHNICAL ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTION TOOLS.
All TO system data input, management practices, and TO acquisition, sustainment and use procedures will be performed
using ETIMS and AF-sanctioned interfacing program tools. Exceptions are listed in TO 00-5-1 and this TO.
1.3.1 Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS). ETIMS, a secure web GCSS-AF application
accessible via the AF portal, is the AF TO System of Record. ETIMS functions include TO cataloging, ordering and TO
Distribution Office (TODO) account management support. ETIMS is used to acquire, improve, publish, catalog, manage,
store, distribute and display the official TOs needed for the safe and effective operation of AF weapon systems and equip-
ment. ETIMS users are assigned roles that include a set of system privileges using a speciﬁc role to provide capability to
perform various functions. ETIMS interfaces with two other components of the AF Standard TO Management System;
Technical Order Distribution Print Gateway (TODPG) and Security Assistance TO Data System (SATODS). ETIMS also
features an active eTO content repository, an eTO publisher/transformer, and an eTO viewer with online (connected) and
portable (disconnected) modes. Primary users are TOMAs, TODO personnel, TO Distribution Account (TODA) personnel,
TO Library Custodians, and eTool administrators. To access ETIMS, prospective users must ﬁrst obtain a CAC or an
External Certiﬁcate Authority (ECA) with a minimum of a favorable National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) to
establish access to the AF Portal. Once logged on to the AF Portal home page, ETIMS is accessed from the Application A-Z
Listing.
1.3.2 Automated Technical Order System (ATOS). ATOS is a loose-leaf publication and document management sys-
tem for developing, maintaining and sustaining Air Force TOs. ATOS receives, stores and maintains digital TOs and TO
change page data and is capable of producing Adobe® Portable Document Format (PDF) output to meet POD requirements.
ATOS consists of seven subsystems; production control, text capture, text generation, graphics capture, graphics generation,
review and output. ATOS has the capability to convert technical data from a paper source to Standard Generalized Markup
Language (SGML) and accept SGML deliveries from outside sources. The SGML output data is Technical Manual Speciﬁ-
cations and Standards (TMSS) compliant.
NOTE
• The ATOS system is being consolidated with the Integrated Data for Maintenance (IDM) and will continue to
be known as ATOS, a component of the AF Standard TO Management System. The tech-refreshed ATOS
system will provide AF enterprise capability to manage, author and publish TO publication source content data;
e.g., AF TMSS SGML / S1000D XML. The enterprise tech-refreshed ATOS system will be the preferred
system for managing vendor / OEM delivered TO source content and for organic TO Authoring and Publishing
(TOAP).
• TO programs are encouraged to work with their TO Home, Site Functional Offices and ATOS offices to help
plan migration strategies. All ATOS TO content data must be migrated to the tech-refreshed ATOS by 30 Sept
2019. ATOS TO content not migrated by September 2019 will be archived on the consolidated TOAP System
and will require a Revision to be prepared when an approved AFTO Form 252, Publication Change Request is
published.
• TO Programs currently using contractor or other organic editorial capabilities are encouraged to evaluate the
tech-refreshed ATOS capabilities to reduce TO program costs.
1.3.3 Product Support Tool Kit (PSTK) (formerly A&S Tool Kit). The PSTK Tool Kit is designed to provide standard,
repeatable processes to guide the acquisition and sustainment workforce and facilitate life cycle up front planning and
programming. The Tool Kit consists of the Processes Matrix and Checklists. Speciﬁc TO management development and
sustainment checklists are provided within the PSTK Tool Kit and should be used as a guide for Program Managers (PMs)
1-2

and TOMAs throughout the TO life cycle. These ﬁles and checklists can be accessed at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/20955/
EnterpriseMgt/Toolkit/SitePages/Home.aspx. AFLCMC/LG sponsors the PSTK Tool Kit and its content. PSTK Tool Kit
training has been incorporated into several Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) and Defense Acquisition University
(DAU) courses.
1.3.4 Commercial and Government-Furnished Software. Some TOMAs and Technical Content Managers (TCMs)
will require additional software applications to manage digital TO ﬁles. Adobe® Acrobat Pro™ is required for publishing
and managing PDF digital ﬁles. Some programs use commercial publishing tools to develop SGML-tagged TO ﬁles, and
government personnel will need these tools to establish an organic TO sustainment capability. TOMAs and their support
organizations will need Display Formatting Output Speciﬁcation Instances (DFOSI) ArborText Editor and Command Pub-
lishing Suite (CPS) software to publish SGML-tagged ﬁles as HTML eTOs for the AF eTO viewer.
1.3.5 Security Assistance TO Data System (SATODS). SATODS controls the release of TOs/TCTOs to foreign coun-
tries. This system provides documentation and records for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) accounts, including Country
Standard TO (CSTO) indexing, TO processing and shipping labels, TO tracking, and TO cost calculations. Refer to TO
00-5-19.
1.3.6 Automated Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Publication System (AEODPS). The AEODPS is a subset of
the Joint EOD Mobile Field Kit (JEOD MFK) software.
1.3.7 Comprehensive Integrated TO Management System (CITOMS). CITOMS is used in conjunction with ETIMS
to manage TOs at Hill AFB and the AF Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC). CITOMS is also used as a digital TO repository
for active and archived TOs for CITOMS managed programs.
1.3.8 Digital Legacy Data Storage System (DLDSS). DLDSS is a platform to deliver, approve/disapprove, and sustain
typeset technical order updates for ATOS customers.
1.3.9 Defense Integrated and Management of Nuclear Data Services (DIAMONDS). A classiﬁed system used by
the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the AF Nuclear Weapon Center (AFMWC/NCL Logistics Operations
Branch [NCLL]) to manage and distribute Joint Nuclear Weapons Publications System (JNWPS). The capability to use
DIAMONDS must be approved by DTRA and the AFNWC, and a stand-alone DIAMONDS terminal must be installed.
DIAMONDS is available through SIPRNET to limited users.
1.3.10 Prime TO Warehouse System (PTOWS). At Robins AFB (AFLCMC/LG), PTOWS is used to track inventory
of classiﬁed TOs, generate labels outside of other TO systems (i.e. TODPG, SATODS) if required, track printing (Robins-
DLA) and shipping of TOs.
1.3.11 Centralized TO Repository (CTOR) System. CTOR is used as a digital TO repository for active and archived
TOs for CTOR managed programs. The Robins AFB CTOR will provide archive functionality for other programs at other
locations upon request. CTOR also provides a conﬁguration control mechanism for page-oriented, unclassiﬁed technical
orders and associated increments.
1.3.12 Secure TO Repository (STOR). STOR is located at Robins AFB, (AFLCMC/LZP), and is a digital repository for
classiﬁed active and archived TOs up to and including SECRET. STOR also includes a classiﬁed TO authoring facility that
provides the capability to sustain and author classiﬁed TO updates. Programs that have a requirement to author classiﬁed TO
updates can utilize this capability. For more information, contact the Robins TO Site Functional Office (Appendix B).
1.3.13 Integrated Data for Maintenance (IDM) System. IDMs are approved Air Force Systems located at Tinker AFB
and Robins AFB and used to sustain eTOs in Portable Document Format (PDF) and Interactive Electronic Technical
Manuals (IETMs). IDMs are web platforms with an associated IETM viewer. Tinker IDM is managed by AFLCMC/LZP-
Tinker and Robins IDM is managed by AFLCMC/LZP-Robins.
1.3.14 Reliability Asset Monitoring (RAM) System. The RAM System is the AF Maintenance Information System used
to track serialized TCTO compliance, weapon conﬁguration, inspections and other key maintenance data and Operational
Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E) support of missiles/munitions listed in TO 21M-1-101, Operational Instruc-
tions - Field/Depot Level - Reliability Asset Monitoring System.
1.3.15 Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS). REMIS is the AF Maintenance Information Sys-
tem and is used to track TCTO compliance and equipment conﬁguration IAW TO 00-20-1 and TO 00-20-2.

1.3.16 Comprehensive Air Force Technical Order Plan (CAFTOP). The CAFTOP applies to all Air Force programs
regardless of support concept and life cycle. The CAFTOP is a management plan for a speciﬁc list of TOs. The CAFTOP
identiﬁes PM and Lead Command mutual agreements about sustainment and digitization processes, future plans, etc.
CAFTOPs establish technical requirements for acquiring, sustaining, and distributing TOs, and can provide a basis of
estimate for TO requirements. CAFTOP also identiﬁes current status, overall health, and provides a future roadmap for each
program’s TOs to include plans, schedules, and progress in converting to appropriate digital formats. CAFTOP is an annual
process that ends with these requirements being published in the CAFDEx Weapon System Management Support (WSMS)
and Logistics Requirements Determination Process (LRDP) for input into the Program Objective Memorandum (POM).

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
2.1 PROGRAM ROLES.
2.1.1 Program Manager (PM). The PM is responsible for, and with the authority to, accomplish program objectives for
development, production, and sustainment to meet the user’s operational needs. PMs provide TO management for the life
cycle of assigned system/commodity TOs by establishing and assigning qualiﬁed personnel to staff the TO Management
Agency (TOMA) functions. The PM is also responsible for assuring the Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness
(OSS&E) of the system, subsystems, or end items. Delegation of speciﬁc OSS&E responsibilities are documented in writing
and approved by the PM / Chief Engineer (CE). PMs ensure the accuracy and adequacy of TOs by assigning the appropriate,
documented, OSS&E authority to Technical Content Managers (TCMs).
2.1.1.1 Management Location. The TOMA responsibilities shall be established at the location of the acquisition or
modiﬁcation program office. The responsible PM or Supply Chain Manager (SCM - Paragraph 2.1.2) must establish autho-
rizations and funding for personnel to staff the TOMA function at the appropriate location IAW 00-5-series TOs. It is
imperative the TOMA be established as soon as possible, but no later than the Technology Development phase of a program
or during initial staffing for any system or commodity buy, modiﬁcation or sustainment effort. TO management personnel
will be shown in the ETIMS Catalog for each TO. The local TO Site Functional Offices (Appendix B) at the location of the
primary program office shall also be notiﬁed in writing of the assignment or changes in TOMA personnel. This notiﬁcation
shall include name, phone number, email address and role. For AFLCMC managed programs, the PM shall also request
assistance from the AFLCMC TO Home Office (AFLCMC/LG) in the assignment of qualiﬁed TO personnel.
2.1.1.2 For aircraft programs, the TCM function for FMP publications is assigned to a Flight Manual Manager (FMM),
who may also perform the TOMA functions in some cases (AFI 11-215), or programs involving the acquisition or sustain-
ment of aircraft, the PM will appoint FMMs to perform similar functions for ﬂight manual TOs, IAW AFI 11-215, USAF
Flight Manuals Program (FMP).
2.1.1.3 The PM requests training and guidance from their local TO Site Functional Office, as required, for newly assigned
personnel.
2.1.1.4 Programs involving nuclear systems must be coordinated with the AF Nuclear Weapons Center per AFI 63-125
and Chapter 7 of this TO.
2.1.1.5 For acquisition and modiﬁcation programs, the PM’s functional Offices of Primary Responsibility (OPRs) will
participate in requirements determination and preparation of inputs for the Request for Proposal (RFP) and TO Life-Cycle
Management Plan (TOLCMP), help determine TO types and depth of coverage required, and review and approve or
disapprove Contractor Furnished (Aeronautical) Equipment (CFAE/CFE) Notices (CFEN). Ensure requirements meet the
MAJCOM’s digitalization plan/requirements. Ensure sufficient technical data rights are obtained to provide life-cycle sup-
port of the weapon system, including priced options for additional rights if support concepts change. (Also refer to Chapter
3, Acquisition).
2.1.1.6 The PM will manage the pre-notiﬁcation, development, release approval and issue of Interim Technical Orders
(ITOs) and Rapid Action Changes (RACs) for TOs supporting program equipment and commodities.
2.1.2 Supply Chain Manager (SCM). SCMs are designated individuals responsible for managing a line of National
Stock Number (NSN)-coded items. SCM functions include requirements determination; cataloging, standardization and
engineering data management; stock control and distribution; technical management functions; and pricing for their assigned
items. SCMs are responsible for supplying, repairing, and managing materiel (including TOs) to support PMs. SCM func-
tions are combined with PM functions in this TO.
2.1.3 Chief Engineer (CE). As the chief technical authority, the CE leads the implementation of a program’s systems
engineering processes and ensures their integrity including technical risk assessment focused on ensuring OSS&E IAW

2.1.4.3 Include processes to review and formalize TOs, review and approve TO and Preliminary TO (PTO) change
requests, and review and recommend corrective actions on deﬁciency reports affecting TOs. Establish controls to ensure that
veriﬁed TOs are distributed prior to or concurrently with deployment of operational assets. For FMP publications, the FMM
performs these functions IAW AFI 11-215.
2.1.4.4 Establish satellite activities, such as TO Control Units (TOCUs) and Central TOCUs (CTOCUs) when required to
assist with management of TO acquisition and sustainment functions. This may include exercising program insight over
contractors, assisting with reviews, providing local printing specialist support, or performing government receiving inspec-
tion.
2.1.4.5 When cost effective, establish a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the local Defense Contract Management
Agency (DCMA) to provide expertise and assistance with contractor TO Program management.
2.1.4.6 Prepare TO-related inputs to all applicable contractual documents and other program documentation. Participate in
contract fact ﬁnding and negotiations as required. Ensure that RFPs include Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for data
rights adequate to support the weapon system for its entire life cycle. If the support concept includes contractor support,
ensure that priced options are included for additional data deliveries and increased data rights if support concepts change
from contract to organic. (Chapter 3) The TOMA is responsible for evaluating contractor proposals to ensure that exit criteria
for TO veriﬁcation are adequately deﬁned in the Integrated Master Plan (IMP), that adequate resources and Government
Furnished (Aeronautical) Equipment (GFE/GFAE) are planned for incremental veriﬁcation, and that costs are reasonable and
supported by the proposal. (Chapter 3)
2.1.4.7 Ensure that the TM-86-01, Technical Manual Contract Requirements (TMCR), TMSS, Data Item Descriptions
(DID), and other contract documents are tailored to the extent necessary to impose only the essential needs for a particular
application. Air Force acquisition programs shall use the latest version of TMSS speciﬁed in the TMCR to develop MIL-
SPEC TOs, unless existing commercial manuals can be used with no degradation of system or equipment OSS&E.
2.1.4.7.1 Ensure the manner and degree of TMCR tailoring accomplished during contract development is limited to
selection of options allowed in the speciﬁcation or standard itself, and does not alter Document Type Deﬁnition (DTD)
requirements. Submit TMCR tailoring that applies to multiple programs and suggested changes/updates to the local TO Site
Functional Office IAW AFMCI 21-301. The local TO Site Functional Office will coordinate with AFLCMC/LZSA Home

CHAPTER 3
TECHNICAL ORDER MANAGEMENT
SECTION I TECHNICAL ORDER ACQUISITION
3.1 OVERVIEW.
The procedures employed to acquire technical manuals reﬂect the size and complexity of the weapon system or end items
being procured. In every case, there are mandatory events and requirements which must be met to successfully ﬁeld the new
equipment in a supportable manner. The following paragraphs outline a typical TO acquisition program for a new system.
Programs of lesser scope (e.g., commodities or modiﬁcation of existing equipment) may not require all steps or functions.
Working in conjunction with the Program Manager (PM) and Product Support Manager (PSM), the TO Management
Agency/Agent (TOMA) is responsible for executing and managing the TO program. TOMAs are members of the program
office Integrated Product Team (IPT) and will determine how the TO acquisition program will be implemented depending
upon the people involved and the complexity of the program. For all acquisition efforts, the TOMA should be designated as
early as possible to plan the TO development.
3.2 EVENTS AND MEETINGS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNICAL ORDER ACQUISITIONS.
Events and meetings associated with TO acquisitions are described below. All or some of these events/meetings may be
required for programs with TO requirements depending upon the complexity of the program. TOMAs must be familiar with
all acquisition events/meetings regardless of their current workloads. TOMAs should be aware of new systems or programs,
updates and changes to systems, and personnel transfers which can impact their workload. Being knowledgeable of TO
acquisition and sustainment policies will make these transitions much easier. Reference DoD 5010.12-M, Procedures for the
Acquisition and Management of Technical Data.
3.3 ACQUISITION STRATEGY.
Acquisition strategy is the responsibility of the PM/SPM assigned to oversee each program. The TOMA must become very
familiar with the approach to be taken with each program, for the initial ﬁelding, levels of maintenance, style and format for
required TO publications, schedules, funding, and all aspects of the TO program as it relates to the overall program. Planning
and knowing how each of these events impact TO management and development is crucial in avoiding any problems later in
the program.
3.3.1 Data and Data Management (Ref: Defense Acquisition Guidebook).
NOTE
DoD policies and procedures for data and data management in this section are directly applicable to procedures
for technical order development and management in this TO. Italicized statements were added for clarity.
3.3.1.1 Deﬁnition. Data are deﬁned as recorded information regardless of the form or method of recording. The term
includes technical data (including TOs ), computer software documentation, management information, representation of
facts, numbers, or datum of any nature that can be communicated, stored, and processed to form information required by a
contract or agreement to be delivered, or accessed by, the government. The term includes similar information generated
directly by government activities, as well. The data are used to gain insight and provide management and guidance to system
development programs.
3.3.1.2 Scope. For purposes of this TO, data refers to the TOs and source data necessary for or associated with product
development and sustainment, including the data associated with system development; modeling and simulation used in
development or test; test and evaluation; installation; parts; spares; repairs; usage data required for product sustainment;
source and/or supplier data; reclamation; re-use; and cannibalization of the system and its associated commodities. Data
speciﬁcally not included would be data relating to tactical operations information; sensor or communications information;
ﬁnancial transactions; personnel data; transactional data; and other data of a purely business nature.
3-1

--------------------------------------------------

TO 00-5-3
3.3.1.3 Total Life Cycle Systems Management (TLCSM). Under TLCSM, the PM is responsible for Data Management
for the system throughout its life cycle. Data Management is an important part of Life-Cycle Logistics. In that context, Data
Management consists of the disciplined processes and systems that plan for, acquire and/or access, manage, and use data
throughout the total system life cycle.
3.3.1.4 Data Management Deﬁned. Data Management is deﬁned as the process of applying policies, systems and
procedures for identiﬁcation and control of data requirements; for the timely and economical acquisition of such data; for
assuring the adequacy of data; for the access, distribution or communication of the data to the point of use; and for analysis
of data use. This section concentrates on technical, product, and logistics data in support of the development, production,
operation, sustainment, improvement, demilitarization and disposal of a system. This includes both government and contrac-
tor created data.
3.3.1.5 Strategy. The PM should develop a long-term strategy that integrates data requirements across all functional
disciplines to include logistics. A performance-based approach should be used to identify the minimal data required to
cost-effectively operate, maintain and improve the ﬁelded system and to foster source of support competition throughout the
system life cycle. Data should be available in a format that is compatible with the intended user’s environment and a quality
assurance program should be implemented to guarantee the accuracy and completeness of the data. The PM should assess
the long-term needs for technical data rights to support weapon systems and correspondingly, to develop acquisition strate-
gies that address those needs. Because a weapon system may remain in the defense inventory for decades, the decisions
made at the time of acquisition can have far-reaching implications for weapon system support over the system’s life cycle,
and the failure to negotiate adequate technical data rights may impede the government’s ability to sustain the weapons
system. It is during the development of the solicitation and the subsequent negotiation of a proposed contract that the
government is in the best position to negotiate and secure required technical data rights. The PM should consider requiring
an acquisition strategy that provides for a future delivery of sufficient technical data should the need arise to select an
alternative source or to offer the work out for competition.
3.3.1.6 Access vs. Delivery. In many cases, leaving government acquired data in the physical possession of the contrac-
tor and having access to the contractor’s data system is the ideal solution. In addition to data access, the requirement for
government use, reproduction, manipulation, altering or transfer of possession of data should be part of the data acquisition
and management strategy. The contract should specify appropriate government rights to the data acquired, in addition to
requirements for delivery or access. Data, whenever it is delivered to the government, should be formatted in accordance
with accepted data standards to ensure usability by the government. A list of data standard examples can be found in the Air
Force TMCR on the TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. These decisions should be made early in the
acquisition life cycle to avoid unexpected costs to procure, reformat and deliver data.
3.3.1.7 Protecting Data. Whether the data is stored and managed by the government or by industry, the PM is respon-
sible for protecting system data. Policy applicable to data protection, marking, and release can be found in the following:
DoDI 5230.24, DoDD 5230.25, DoDM 5400.07, and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) Part
252.227-7013 & 7014. The Air Force implementing instruction is AFI 61-201
3.3.1.8 Additional Guidance. Industry standards from organizations such as the Government Electronics and Information
Association (GEIA), International Standards Organization (ISO) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI), provide
high level principles to guide integrated data management planning, and implementation. The GEIA Handbook ANSI
GEIA-859, Data Management Standard , is a guide that may be helpful for PMs and data managers. This handbook outlines
principles and processes for the management of data including data interoperability and longevity, best practices, and long
term electronic storage, use, and recovery of data.
3.3.2 Program Planning. The ﬁrst step in any program or project is to determine the scope and requirements. The TOMA
initiates this process for TOs by reviewing program documentation and developing a preliminary plan of action. The TOMA
will review the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), Capability Development Document (CDD), Operational Concept,
Maintenance Concept, and other documents to determine the correct acquisition strategy for each new program. This strategy
should be reﬂected in the TO Life Cycle Management Plan (TOLCMP), wording for the Statement of Objective (SOO),
Evaluation Criteria, and Instructions to Offeror.
3.3.2.1 Technical Order Life Cycle Management Plan (TOLCMP). A TOLCMP is mandatory for all programs not
exempt from the USAF TO System (IAW TO 00-5-1) when TOs must be developed or are impacted. When multiple
programs are managed within the same program office, one TOLCMP may be developed and updated, as required, to deﬁne
speciﬁc program requirements for each effort. The TOLCMP shall include a TO Concept of Operations (TO CONOPS)
deﬁning the user vision for operation and use of TOs being developed and how the TOs will support operations and
maintenance of the system. The TO CONOPS should also be included as part of the TM 86-01, Technical Manual Contract
3-2

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_34
TO 00-5-3
Requirements (TMCR) developed for the program. When technical data is to be developed IAW ASD-S1000D, International
Speciﬁcation for Technical Publications Utilizing a Common Source Database, the TOLCMP shall address how the required
CSDB management capability will be acquired and sustained. AF TO Programs desiring to implement S1000D/IETM
initiatives shall utilize all available/applicable AF (APL) tools and resources for the implementation and organic sustainment
of IETM/S1000D tech data, i.e., Content Management System (CMS), distribution and COTS/GOTS viewing software, etc.
Systems and/or tools provided by the contractor shall be made interoperable with AF infrastructure/technology. The TOLCMP
is developed by the TOMA, then coordinated and approved at the TO Planning/Requirements Conference (TOP/RC) by the
TO IPT members. It outlines management policies and procedures for the development, acquisition, reproduction, distribu-
tion and archive procedures of TOs on any military system or commodity program throughout the program and entire TO
life cycle. The TOLCMP must address timely acquisition of PTOs or source data with a format and depth of coverage
adequate to support test activities. Air Force TO proponents for joint DoD and international weapon system acquisition
programs shall develop and maintain copies of the AF TOLCMP and TOLCVP for the life of the program. The TOLCMP
shall be attached to the Weapon System Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP). The TOLCMP is not a static management
document and shall be reviewed annually and updated as required by the TOMA during the Comprehensive Air Force
Technical Order Plan (CAFTOP) update. Copies of the TOLCMP and all updates shall also be sent to the TO Site Functional
Office at the PM location. See generic TOLCMP’s on the TOMA SharePoint site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).
3.3.2.2 Technical Order Life Cycle Veriﬁcation Plan (TOLCVP). Veriﬁcation is the formal process by which Air Force
personnel evaluate and prove new TOs developed during acquisition and TO updates developed during sustainment are
accurate, adequate, safe, and usable in the operational environment to support the program. Planning for veriﬁcation of TOs
shall be initiated at the TO Planning/Requirements Conference (or by the TOMA if no conference is held), based upon the
needs of the MAJCOM and other affected agencies. The TOLCVP is mandatory for all programs and should be developed as
soon as possible in the acquisition program. For programs with multiple modiﬁcations, the TOLCVP should be updated to
cover any unique procedures, processes and schedule required. Preparation of a complete new TOLCVP for each modiﬁca-
tion program is not required provided the base system TOLCVP adequately addresses the veriﬁcation process to be used.
Like the TOLCMP, the TOLCVP is not a static management document and shall be reviewed annually and updated as
required by the TOMA during the CAFTOP update. When a TOLCMP is developed, the TOLCVP will be an attachment to
the TOLCMP. The TOLCVP shall include identiﬁcation of procedures to be veriﬁed, the veriﬁcation site, the Veriﬁcation
Team Manager (VTM), support equipment and consumables required, schedules, use of substitute equipment and veriﬁcation
procedures and processes. The TOLCVP shall cover documentation processes and procedures for the veriﬁcation activities.
The TOLCVP shall also be updated to cover the processes and procedures to be used to verify TO updates after the TO is
formalized and enters the sustainment phase of the TO life cycle. If contractor support is required during veriﬁcation, the
requirements for support shall be deﬁned in the TMCR. See the generic TOLCVP on the TOMA SharePoint site (https://
cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531) Copies of the TOLCVP and all updates shall also be sent to the TO Site Functional Office at the
PM location.
3.3.2.2.1 The program veriﬁcation schedule must be developed in conjunction with the Air Force test plan, production
schedules and deployment schedules to ensure the availability of hardware, software, and equipment to support the veriﬁ-
cation effort. If available, the tentative schedule should be provided to offerors in the Request for Proposal (RFP) to allow
development of supportive schedules.
3.3.2.2.2 TO veriﬁcation will make maximum use of other scheduled events, such as test and evaluation, prototyping, and
maintainability demonstrations. Activities should not be duplicated. Use unscheduled events such as equipment failure to
verify applicable procedures, when possible.
3.3.2.3 Contractor Developed Technical Manual Organization Plan (TMOP). The contract may include the develop-
ment and delivery of a TMOP through the use of Data Item DI-TMSS-81810. The contractor TMOP does not, however,
replace the requirement for a TOLCMP on programs. This TMOP, when developed, should be attached as part of TOLCMP.
3.3.2.4 Technical Manual Content and Product Plan (TMCPP). For S1000D IETM development, the contract should
include the development of a TMCPP as a deliverable within the TMCR. The TMCPP should be delivered in contractor
format and specify the end-to-end development and integration of the IETM. The current version of the TMCR provides
detailed requirements that should be included within the Contractor’s plan.
3.3.3 Contractor Logistics Supportability/Total System Integration Responsibility (TSIR) Contracts. If the program
will be sustained by the contractor for life, the TOMA must engage in writing technical order requirements to deﬁne the role
of the contractor sustainment responsibility. Since these arrangements require contractors to sustain technical manuals for the
life of the program, considerations must be addressed, i.e., the number of changes to be issued annually, a surge capability
3-3

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_35
TO 00-5-3
for Urgent or Emergency situations, and the ﬂow of recommended changes. Budgets must also be addressed to ensure the
PMs include all TO related cost in their Program Objective Memorandum (POM) submittals. Programs identify TO
sustainment funding through the annual CAFTOP process (Paragraph 3.5.2).
3.4 REQUIREMENTS PLANNING CONFERENCE.
3.4.1 Requirements Conference. The TOMA will call and chair a TO Planning/Requirements Conference (TOP/RC),
and request support from others as required, for new program starts. TOP/RC membership is the nucleus of the IPT working
a TO program and includes the Lead Commands and MAJCOMs, other AFMC managers and support agencies. The TOP/RC
ﬁnalizes the requirements for input to the RFP. As a minimum, the team must include representatives from other AFMC
activities, including the FMM when appropriate, the ESs and Joint Services Managers, and the MAJCOM(s) and any other
support agencies (if required). The safety and nuclear surety offices, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and the
Responsible Test Organization (RTO) should be included on the team. Contractor representatives should be included as soon
as the contract is issued, with contracting officer concurrence.
3.4.2 TO Planning/Requirements Conference (TOP/RC) Membership Agreements. The TOP/RC, held before the
program data call, brings together the members of the TO IPT to plan the TO program. Membership continuity in subsequent
conferences and reviews must be maintained whenever possible. Once the program TO requirements is developed, inputs to
the RFP are drafted and the TOLCMP is ﬁnalized.
3.4.3 Purpose. The TOMA will conduct a joint TOP/RC with the TO IPT. The TOP/RC will identify TO program
requirements, prepare TO program schedules, determine what source data is required to support TO development, and plan
for TO veriﬁcation. One critical task often overlooked is to review the TO speciﬁcations and standards which will be
required on the program. If this is not done by the TOP/RC, then the TOMA must review the contractor-proposed tailoring
before the contract is issued to ensure Air Force requirements are met.
3.4.3.1 The conference may be accomplished through face-to-face meetings, correspondence, telephone or other electronic
communication. At the completion of the TOP/RC, the TOMA will document all actions and ﬁnalize the RFP and the
TOLCMP.
3.4.3.2 When more than one MAJCOM or DoD component is involved, the Lead Command or component, as identiﬁed
in the Program Management Directive (PMD), should be the primary source of requirements information. Requirements
from other MAJCOMs should also be considered in TO planning efforts. The planning and requirements derived from this
conference must follow the established Air Force operation, maintenance and logistics support concepts and plans.
3.4.3.3 The IPT should plan for the use of existing TOs and commercial manuals whenever possible, identify required
new TO types and speciﬁcations, and establish program milestones based on the PMD.
3.4.3.4 The TO IPT shall evaluate all TO program requirements. Any changes in scope or increase in requirements will be
thoroughly evaluated and documented in the TOLCMP. Consideration should be given to cost versus effectiveness, trade-
offs, alternatives, the MAJCOM digitization plan, and the AF TO CONOPS. When disagreements cannot be resolved, the
TOMA will elevate the matter for resolution to the PSM and in turn to the PM.
3.4.4 Existing Data Usability. Maximum use will be made of existing data. Available Technical Manuals (TM) from
other government departments or agencies will be reviewed to determine adequacy and application to particular programs.
3.4.5 TO Development Planning. Any TOs developed for the government (at government expense) must be developed
to current AF TMSS or a government-approved NGS IAW this TO. See Section VIII for digital TO and TMSS requirements.
3.4.5.1 Joint Acquisition Programs. For joint-service acquisition programs, TMs should be developed in a single format
usable by all services involved, rather than developing individual manuals for each service.
3.4.5.2 Delivery Requirements. Delivery of PTOs shall be prior to or concurrent with delivery of the hardware for
development testing and/or operational need dates. Formal organizational level (on-equipment) TOs and preliminary inter-
mediate level (off-equipment) TOs will be delivered prior to or concurrently with the delivery of the ﬁrst production
conﬁgured system or commodity to the ﬁrst operational unit. Intermediate-level manuals must be formalized by the Initial
Operational Capability (IOC) date.
3-4

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_36
TO 00-5-3
3.4.5.2.1 For the two-level maintenance concept, ﬁeld level TOs meeting the deﬁnitions of on-equipment and off-equip-
ment must meet the delivery requirements of Organizational and Intermediate-level manuals, respectively. Preliminary depot
level TOs will be delivered prior to depot prototype overhaul and must be veriﬁed and formalized prior to depot activation.
3.4.5.2.2 If TOs cannot be delivered according to this policy, the TOMA must revise veriﬁcation schedules, update the
TOLCMP, and recommend interim support for the MAJCOM, use of veriﬁed or partly veriﬁed PTOs, Interim Contractor
Support (ICS, AFI 63-111, Contract Support for Systems, Equipment and End-Items, etc.) until the manuals are delivered.
Any such actions must be coordinated with and approved by the appropriate PM and the MAJCOM/DoD Component.
3.4.5.3 Preliminary Technical Orders (PTOs).
3.4.5.3.1 ETIMS will only manage PTO numbering and indexing. TOMAs establish procedures to manage and control
distribution of PTOs prior to formalization and publication as stated in Paragraph 5.2.
3.4.5.3.2 The TOMA requests a TO number for PTOs using the same procedures as in Paragraph 3.9.3.1. AFLCMC/
LZPTP-TINKER enters the approved number in the ETIMS Review TO Number Request screen. The TOMA receives a
notiﬁcation on their Home Screen indicating the TO number has been reviewed/approved. The TOMA will use the Manage
TO Screens to index the PTO, marking Available for Index to Yes so users are able to establish ID.
3.4.5.3.3 PTOs are prepared in limited quantities during TO acquisition to support In-Process Reviews (IPRs), contractor
certiﬁcation, and government veriﬁcation activities. A TO is considered ’preliminary’ from the time the publication has a
number assigned until the TO is formalized. PTOs are formalized after they are successfully veriﬁed and all corrections are
made and accepted, normally during a pre-pub review. PTOs must complete the contractor quality process before delivery to
the government for veriﬁcation. Air Force personnel may use unveriﬁed data during system Test and Evaluation (T&E) on
new or modiﬁed hardware or software or in the performance of routine maintenance if the intent is to verify the data. Every
effort shall be made to replace organizational-level PTOs with formal TOs prior to or concurrent with delivery of the ﬁrst
production-conﬁgured system or commodity to the ﬁrst operational unit. Formatted PTOs should be used to the maximum
extent possible to support Air Force T&E (AFI 63-101/20-101). PTOs are also normally used for development of formatted
training plans and course syllabuses.
3.4.5.3.4 Verifying and Formalizing PTOs. After the TO has been veriﬁed to the maximum extent possible, the TOMA
develops a TO update to convert the PTO to a formal TO. Prior to distribution of formal TO/eTO update, the TOMA will
enter the publication date. The Available for Distribution ﬂag in the TO index is automatically set to Yes when the content is
loaded to TODPG (for distributed media) or eTO is deployed (for–WA-1). ETIMS will automatically enter the estimated
distribution date (EDD) from TODPG when the AFD is set to Yes. The Available for Distribution ﬂag shall be manually set
to Yes by the TOMA to indicate a -WA-2 is available for distribution. For all media types the Available for Index ﬂag must
be set to Yes and Publication Stock Number (PSN) created by ETIMS for catalog to be updated.
3.5 DEVELOPING ESTIMATED BUDGET FOR PM TO COVER TO COSTS.
3.5.1 TO Initial Acquisition Budgeting and Cost Estimating. The TOMA is responsible for estimating the cost of TOs
needed to support the military system or commodity. The cost of acquiring TOs includes writing, editing, supporting
conferences and reviews, veriﬁcation, preparation of reproducible masters, printing and distribution, routine maintenance,
and TO-related travel (AFI 65-601V1). TO costs are chargeable to the same budget program activity code used to ﬁnance
hardware costs during initial acquisition. The TOMA must begin the cost estimating process shortly after assignment to
ensure adequate program funds are available. All information sources should be explored, including, but not limited to,
historical data from other programs, contractor estimates, and prior experience. The PM must ensure the annual program
budget submission includes TO requirements.
3.5.2 Sustainment Funding and Program Brochure Transfer. TOMAs must begin planning for the seamless transfer
of TO programs from the acquisition phase to sustainment phase as soon as possible after test and evaluation. TOMAs shall
use the CAFTOP to plan and schedule compliance with these funding requirements (see Chapter 5 for sustainment CAFTOP
processes). Exemptions and deviations must be authorized by waivers (see Paragraph 1.2.1). PMs/TOMAs will use the
CAFTOP Working Group SharePoint site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10792/default.aspx) to access the CAFTOP Handbook,
the Technical Order Requirements Process. Use CAFTOP Handbook procedures to develop a weapon system/commodity-
speciﬁc CAFTOP Annex for submission to the appropriate Lead Command (AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and
Responsibilities for Weapon Systems, in time to support a budget submission for the current Future Years Defense Plan
(FYDP). AFI 65-601(v1), Section 4E, describes the complete funding requirements for Air Force technical manuals. Funding
for physical-distribution digital media (e.g. CD-ROMs or DVDs) is managed the same as funding for individual TOs,
through the CAFTOP process.
3-5

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_37
TO 00-5-3
3.5.3 Modiﬁcations Funding. The PM will address all Time Compliance TOs (TCTOs), new Operations and Maintenance
(O&M) TOs, and O&M TO updates required to support planned modiﬁcations in the Technical Order Financial Brochure
(TOFB) and CAFTOP Annex submitted to the Lead Command for funding. However, TCTO and related new TOs or TO
updates are funded by the speciﬁc modiﬁcation project.
NOTE
Some acquisition program contracts provide for system upgrades as part of the contracted effort. Sustainment
programs must use modiﬁcation funding for all TCTOs and TCTO-related TO updates, publication and distribu-
tion.
3.5.3.1 The TOMA ensures funding requirements for TCTO acquisition, veriﬁcation, related TO updates, printing and
distribution have been considered in modiﬁcation funding packages. Requirements include costs to remove before and add
after data (before and after modiﬁcation) in TOs. (For S1000D/IETM based TOs, refer to Section VIII).
3.5.3.2 The TOMA annotates the fund citation or modiﬁcation number in the print package submitted to the Technical
Order Distribution Print Gateway (TODPG) (Reference Functional Users Guide (FUG) at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).
If the package also contains non-modiﬁcation-related changes, the annotation will show the related fund citations and the
percentage chargeable to each.
3.5.3.3 For Inspection Program (-6 TO) changes that will cause depot maintenance Depot Programmed Equipment Main-
tenance (DPEM) fund obligations, the responsible Production Management Activity (PMA) (for TCTO modiﬁcation kits)
will contact the DPEM funds point of contact to ensure adequate funds are available. The PMA will procure and manage the
available funds per AFI 65-601V1 and associated AFMC supplements.
3.5.3.4 Spares Replacement. Acquisition funds and the stock fund are used to acquire new TOs or TO updates driven
by the need to replace existing spare parts and components with new items. The Product Group Manager (PGM) provides
the TOMA with a printout of the replacement item cost computation. The TOMA annotates the total dollar requirement for
the maintenance of commodity TOs resulting from the acquisition of replacement spare items. The TCM will assist the
TOMA with computing the impact of spares replenishment on weapon systems TOs based on history and known future
acquisitions. The TOMA provides budget requirements by weapon system.
3.6 CONTRACTING FOR TECHNICAL ORDERS.
TOs will be acquired IAW DoD 5010.12-M, Procedures for the Acquisition and Management of Technical Data, on a
separately priced Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) using a contract exhibit consisting of a DD Form 1423, Contract
Data Requirements List (CDRL), with a program-speciﬁc (tailored) TM 86-01, Technical Manual Contract Requirements
(TMCR) document. The TMCR is managed by HQ AFMC/A4F in coordination with other acquisition agencies. The latest
version of the TMCR, located on the AF TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531 must be used for all new
TO contracts. Programs may submit a waiver through their Center TO Home Office if their current TMCR is adequately
supporting the program. TOMA/PM must coordinate on the development of CDRLs and TMCR of new contracting actions
for the purchase or sustainment of TOs. The local TO Functional Site Office will provide guidance to TOMAs, FMMs and
TCMs with TO acquisition, development, review, and veriﬁcation of assigned systems. This includes providing support to
TOMAs and TCMs on the development of new contracting actions and providing local, specialized training IAW AFMCI
21-301.
3.6.1 Technical Manual Contract Requirements (TMCR) Document, TM 86-01. A TMCR is used in all contracts for
acquisition, sustainment or modiﬁcation of systems and equipment when TOs must be developed or updated. The TMCR is
included in the RFP either as an exhibit, as part of the system performance speciﬁcation, or in the Technical Library, and is
referenced in Section J. The exhibit will have a separately-priced CLIN in the formal contract (DoD 5010.12-M).
NOTE
TMCR requirements apply equally to contracted TO development efforts and to in-house TO development and
updating.
3.6.2 Description. The TMCR Template now consists of two parts: The ﬁrst for the acquisition of TMSS compliant linear
technical manuals, and the second part for the acquisition of S1000D IETMs. Programs will only need to tailor one of the
parts for their acquisition activity and delete the unused part. The TMCR consists of three sections; TO Program Require-
ments, TM Type and Delivery Requirements, and Speciﬁcation/Standards Interface Records (SIR). Section 1 deﬁnes speciﬁc

program requirements the contractor shall follow in development or sustainment of the TO data identiﬁed in Section 2.
Section 2 includes tables listing TO types and related TMSS, source data requirements, speciﬁc TOs requiring update to
support TO sustainment or modiﬁcations, and matrices providing delivery instructions with data formats for various phases
of the program. Section 3 contains the SIRs for joint-service TMSS with Air Force tailoring speciﬁed and contains links to
the TMSS Tailoring Tool and the S1000D Decision Point Tool. TOMAs will utilize both tools to specify their standard
TMSS tailoring requirements and/or to specify their S1000D functionality requirements and program business rules. The
outputs provided from these tools will be attached to Section 3 as contractual SIR requirements. The TOMA is responsible
to tailor the entire TMCR prior to placing the TMCR in an exhibit to the contract. The Contractor/Offeror may propose and
submit, in writing, additional tailoring to the TOMA and Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) for consideration. If approved,
this additional tailoring shall be added to the TMCR as part of the contract deliverable. Programs that have developed a TO
Concept of Operations (TO CONOPS) may attach the TO CONOPS to the TMCR to aid the contractor in understanding the
program requirements. A published overarching Air Force TO CONOPS is available at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12837/
afkn_docs/forms/allitems.aspx.
3.6.3 Tailoring. Tailoring serves two purposes; to delete TMCR requirements excess to program needs, and select options
presented within speciﬁcations and standards. Only those TM Type Selection Tables, TM Delivery Requirements Matrices
and SIRs applicable to a particular contract are left in the TMCR. A TMCR Writing Guide is available on the TOMA
SharePoint Site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531/default.aspx to assist programs in tailoring their contractual requirements.
Examples of TMCR tailoring can be found in the TMCR folder on the LZSA SharePoint (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/20955/
logistics%20program%20support/default.aspx).
NOTE
Updates to existing TOs and new TOs for existing programs may be acquired in same style and format when this
is satisfactory to all affected agencies and is cost effective over the program life cycle. In these cases, list the TOs
affected in TMCR Table 2. However, if any existing SGML-tagged formats are not TMSS compliant and cannot
be viewed on the eTO Viewer (eTOV), revisions and new TOs which will be converted to HTML or XML and
distributed as eTOs must be brought into compatibility with the eTOV. If this is not possible (funding limitations,
contractual issues, etc.), the PM must obtain approval from the Lead Command and get an AFMC/A4F waiver to
host eTOs sites other than the ETIMS repository. For these waived manuals, index the media suffix-WA-2, and list
the URL in the TO Details page. If the TOs can be distributed in PDF, no re-writes are required.
3.6.4 DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). The DD 1423 is used to establish a separately priced
CLIN. It is usually attached with the TMCR in the contract and listed in the Part I, Section B, Supplies or Services and
pricing/cost schedule as well as Part III - List of Documents, Exhibits, and Other Attachments, Section J, List of Attach-
ments. A separate CDRL, identiﬁed as an exhibit to the contract, shall be used in conjunction with the CLIN for TOs. CDRL
Block 4, Authority, shall list the Air Force TMCR, TM 86-01, in place of a Data Item Description (DID) or TMSS. The
TMCR must be tailored to list only the military speciﬁcations or standards applicable to the contract. Multiple TO CDRLs
may be used to price TOs by work segment, e.g., Organizational level TOs, Depot level TOs, and Operational TOs. The
respective TMCRs will be attached to the CDRLs. For convenience, multiple TO CDRLs may be grouped together in one
contract exhibit or separate contract exhibits may be established for each CDRL. In either case a separate price for each
CDRL should be in the exhibit or on the CDRL.
3.6.4.1 Options. There are two options for the use of CDRLs:
3.6.4.1.1 The TOMA may include draft CDRLs for known data requirements in the RFP. The CDRL for TO delivery (if
included), with the TMCR attached, will be referenced in RFP Section J. The Instruction to Offerors will require the offerors
to develop Statement of Work (SOW) paragraphs, complete CDRL tailoring and submit any other suggested data require-
ment CDRLs with the proposals.
3.6.4.1.2 If CDRLs are not included in the RFP, the Instruction to Offerors will require offerors to propose all data
requirements, including TOs. In this case, a partly-tailored TMCR may be placed in either the system speciﬁcation or the
Proposal Technical Library.

3.6.5 Data Item Descriptions (DIDs). Following is a listing of most of the TO program-related Data Items which may be
required if the contractor will develop/deliver the data:
• DI-TMSS-80067, Technical Manual (TM) Contractor Furnished Aeronautical Equipment or Contractor Furnished
Equipment (CFAE/CFE) Notices.
• DI-TMSS-80229, Technical Order Improvement Report and Reply (AFTO Form 22).
• DI-SAFT-80931, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Data.
• DI-TMSS-81532, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information (Emergency Services) Source
Data.
• DI-ALSS-81531, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Supply Data (AFTO Form 874).
• DI-TMSS-81810, Technical Manual Organization Plan.
• DI-TMSS-81817, Technical Manual Quality Assurance (TMQA) Program Plan
• DI-SESS-80858, Suppliers Conﬁguration Management Plan
• DI-TMSS-81812, Technical Manual Schedule and Status Report
3.7 PROVIDING INPUT FOR SOO, SOW, ICD, RFP, INSTRUCTION TO OFFERORS, ETC.
3.7.1 Statement of Objectives (SOO).
3.7.1.1 Deﬁnition and Purpose. The SOO should specify TO objectives in performance-based terminology. Evaluation
criteria must support the SOO and be traceable to the Instruction to Offerors sections. The SOO is a government-prepared
attachment to either Section J or L of the RFP. The SOO provides the basic, top-level objectives of the acquisition program.
Additionally, program objectives focus on the higher risk areas individually, so each area can be addressed directly in the
evaluation criteria. These higher risk areas are usually valid discriminators in the source selection process. Areas of relatively
low risk are generally covered by higher level objectives. The SOO allows the offeror maximum ﬂexibility to develop
cost-effective solutions and to propose innovative alternatives to meet the stated objectives. The SOO also allows the
government to assess offeror understanding of the effort to be performed, by eliminating the how to instructions typically
provided in a SOW, (MIL-HDBK-245, Preparation of Statement of Work (SOW)).
3.7.1.2 Phrasing Objectives. Depending on the level of risk, TO objectives will be addressed in a variety of ways. For
most acquisition programs, the TO objective would be covered with a statement such as: Provide quality technical manuals,
source data and options for the government to obtain data acquisition rights to support the objective of Air Force organic
system operation and ﬁeld and depot-level maintenance for the system life cycle. Actual wording will depend on program
operations and maintenance concepts. Where TOs are considered a low-risk area, TO objectives may be covered by the more
general logistics support objective.
3.7.2 Work Statement Options.
3.7.2.1 Statement of Work (SOW). A SOW deﬁnes, either directly or by reference to other documents, all tasks to be
performed for the program covered by the contract. The SOW is limited to what is required - qualitative, quantitative and
other requirements (how, when and where) will be contained in speciﬁcations, the Integrated Master Plan (IMP) and CDRLs
(MIL-HDBK-245 and DoD 5010.12-M). Use of a SOW in the RFP is usually limited to follow-on or small program
contracts, as directed by the PM.
3.7.2.2 Government-Prepared SOWs. For government-prepared SOWs, TO requirements should be limited to perfor-
mance-based statements, e.g., The contractor shall develop the technical order types speciﬁed in the TMCR (Exhibit) to
support (program name) (CDRL (#)). Additional statements, covering the applicable task areas may either be added to the
SOW or to the ﬁrst section of the TMCR as required to fully describe TO program requirements.
3-8

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_40
TO 00-5-3
3.7.2.3 Offeror-Prepared SOWs. Offeror-prepared SOWs may vary in detail, dependent upon the detail in the IMP. The
proposal SOW and IMP together should specify the tasks, events and processes the offeror will use to satisfy RFP require-
ments. The Instruction to Offerors must be explicit enough to allow the contractor to tailor a TMCR for submittal with the
proposal.
3.7.2.4 Performance-Based Work Statements (PWS). A PWS deﬁnes the requirements in terms of results rather than
the method of performing the work. It cites referenced directives by speciﬁc process/procedure (e.g., paragraph or chapter)
rather than the entire publication. At a minimum, a PWS includes a description of Services/General Information (deﬁnitions,
etc.); a Services Summary; a list of Government-Furnished Property and Services, if applicable; and Appendices such as
workload estimates, labor hour rates, square footage, etc.
3.7.3 Request for Proposal (RFP).
3.7.3.1 The TOMA will make inputs to the PM data call to ensure that TO-related data is placed on contract. The TOMA
must ensure that the proper FAR/DFARS data rights clauses are included in the RFP. These requirements will not be altered
by the PM or Data Manager without the concurrence of the TOMA, MAJCOM and support agencies. The Instruction to
Offerors will inform contractors responding to the RFP about information to be included in the proposal. Evaluation Criteria
(section M of the RFP) must be traceable to both the SOO and Instruction to Offerors. AFI 63-101/20-101 describes the
procedures for securing data rights, ensuring technical data is addressed in the RFP and for ensuring costs associated with
technical data are visible and contain supporting documentation.
3.7.3.2 CDRL, TMCR and CLIN. The government shall develop a draft TMCR for the RFP. This TMCR shall be updated
based on approved contractor data recommendations for inclusion in the ﬁnal contract. The TMCR is attached to the CDRL
for delivery of TOs. The TMCR shall require a separate CLIN for delivery of Technical Manuals, and shall become a
separately-priced exhibit to the contract (DFARS 227.7103-2, Acquisition of Technical Data, and DoD 5010.12-M). The RFP
must include a separate CLIN asking for a priced option to obtain unlimited rights to technical data if the Offeror has
proposed only limited rights. (Paragraph 3.20.2.4.)
3.7.3.3 The TO IPT (Paragraph 3.4.1) develops draft TO program objectives and criteria as inputs for the work statement
or SOO, Evaluation Criteria and Instruction to Offerors. The drafts are provided to the program contracting office and data
manager, along with a partly-tailored TMCR for inclusion in the RFP system performance speciﬁcation.
3.7.3.4 If the RFP includes TOs releasable under provisions of AFI 61-201, they may be released directly to prospective
bidders. If the RFP includes TOs not releasable under provisions of AFI 61-201, they should be made available for review in
a bidder’s library at the buying location. For those TOs which are only distributed as ETIMS electronic TOs (eTOs), the PM
may direct the TOMA to upload the eTOs to the eTO viewer. Release of export-controlled technical orders outside of DoD
requires completion of a DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.
3.7.4 Instructions to Offerors.
3.7.4.1 The Instructions to Offeror, Section L of the RFP, identiﬁes how the offerors must submit proposals and what
proposals must cover for the government to evaluate the proposal according to the evaluation criteria in Section M. For
example, the Instructions to Offeror may require a tailored TMCR, associated SOW tasks, and IMP program event entrance
and exit criteria. The Instructions to Offeror essentially addresses topics contained in TMCR Section 1. Offerors will be
required to select and tailor applicable TMSS, listed in the TMCR, for the types of TOs required by the program.
3.7.4.2 Proposals. Offerors respond to an RFP with proposals for satisfying Air Force objectives. Proposals are evaluated
IAW the AF Source Selection Plan.
3.7.4.3 Proposal Contents. Offeror proposals submitted in response to an RFP will include any documents the RFP
requires. That will usually include some combination of a work statement, completed (separately priced) TMCR for TOs,
recommendations for any other data required, an IMP, and/or an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS -Appendix A) covering
the management and control of the acquisition program. Offeror responses indicate how the contractor intends to satisfy RFP
requirements.
3.7.4.3.1 Request for Proposal Quality Assurance Provisions. The Instructions to Offeror may require the offeror to
include details of the contractor QA process in their proposal, if the process has not been previously documented and
supported by applicable past performance data or if there is exceptional risk in the program. The process will be evaluated
for conformance to accepted commercial standards, such as the ISO 9000 series. The TOMA will obtain insight into process

operation through participation in the IPT. Digital data deliveries are inspected and accepted on several levels: 1) physical
media, 2) data exchange formats and, 3) data content and format. Contractors must demonstrate the online access service as
the basis for government acceptance. TOs delivered pursuant to the contract must meet the requirements of this chapter and
the contractor’s tailored TMCR. The quality of proposed commercial manuals will be evaluated according to MIL-PRF-
32216, Evaluation of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Manual and Preparation of Supplemental Data.
3.8 SOURCE SELECTION PROCESS.
During source selection the government will review and clarify any issues with the TMCR and RFP. Source Selection rules
determine how the government will ask questions and negotiate unresolved issues. On-site visits to contractors may be
required. The ﬁnal evaluation results are presented to a Source Selection Authority to determine which offeror best satisﬁes
the RFP. That offeror is subsequently awarded the contract. Once contracts are awarded, the provisions may only be changed
through the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).
3.8.1 Proposal Evaluation Criteria. The following provides guidance for TOMA evaluation of TO acquisition or sustain-
ment contract cost and delivery proposals, and participation in subsequent negotiations with the offeror, under the direction
of the PCO. The TOMA should be knowledgeable in all relevant areas of TO acquisition or sustainment, and must thor-
oughly understand program requirements, the RFP, and the evaluation criteria. Assistance and comments should be solicited
from appropriate PM or staff agency personnel if some parts of the proposal are beyond TOMA expertise and experience.
During competitive contract bidding, the TOMA must not contact any bidder directly. There must be no bias or any
appearance of conﬂict of interest.
3.8.1.1 Evaluation Criteria. Evaluation criteria, Section M of the RFP, will be developed based upon the SOO and will
drive development of the Instruction to Offerors (Section L of the RFP). TO inputs will be prepared by the TOMA to support
and establish standards for evaluation of an offeror response to the RFP. Section M informs offerors how the government will
evaluate and rank proposals. For TOs, a primary criterion is development IAW Air Force TMSS to ensure ETIMS compat-
ibility. Other criteria include complete program coverage, acceptable in-house processes to ensure delivery of technically
accurate documents and data, past performance and support of government veriﬁcation.
3.8.1.2 Developing Evaluation Criteria and Checklists. Documented criteria must be developed from program require-
ments prior to RFP release. These evaluation criteria (or a checklist), must be used to analyze any proposals. The criteria
should list the requirements in rank order and establish the minimum acceptable level of compliance for a proposal to be
considered acceptable, consistent with the evaluation factors. The criteria may be either quantitative or qualitative depending
upon the factors or sub-factors addressed. The criteria will allow all proposals submitted against an RFP to be evaluated to
the same standards and help to prevent any charges of bias or unfair practices. The TOMA, in conjunction with the IPT, will
develop TO program evaluation criteria.
3.8.2 Technical Evaluation. The purpose of the TO technical evaluation is to determine whether offeror proposals meet
the requirements of the RFP, and offeror-proposed hours allocated for TO development are realistic, complete, fair and
reasonable in relationship to the RFP. The evaluation should assess offeror understanding of and ability to comply with
program requirements based on the proposal, Contractor Performance Assessment Reports (CPAR, available from the PCO)
or site surveys, interviews, etc. The quality of the contractor processes and ability to provide an acceptable product are
primary concerns. The principal TOMA role is to evaluate the technical merit of the TO portion of the proposal.
3.8.2.1 TOMA Role. The TOMAs primary role is to evaluate proposal compliance with an understanding of RFP provi-
sions and the adequacy and accuracy of individual elements relating to technical data development.
3.8.2.2 Assess whether the proposal is realistic or not by comparing offeror proposed efforts with similar contracts on
other programs, both by the same offeror and by other contractors of similar size and capabilities.
3.8.2.3 For page-oriented TOs, consider such elements as hours per page (new and changed), number of pages (new and
changed), types of pages (text, illustration, and mixed), travel costs (location, duration, number of people), and hours for
TO-related plans and reports.
3.8.2.4 For IETM/S1000D based TOs, evaluation elements will depend on the offeror units of measurement. Some ele-
ments included could be number and complexity of tasks, lines of software code, number, format and complexity of
illustrations, etc. (Section VIII.) Because proposals associated with IETM technical data development include a Common
Source Database (CSDB) management component, a CSDB expert should be assigned to the source selection team. Digital
3-10

TO 00-5-3
ﬁles consist of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) data modules, Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) ﬁles,
FrameMaker® ﬁles, etc. DB Manager requirements and responsibilities are contained in Appendix C. All pre-S1000D Type
II IETMs that capitalize off data reuse fall under this requirement if they are organically sustained by the AF.
3.8.2.5 If the offeror based proposal costs for some elements on historical data, the TOMA should evaluate the validity of
the data used; i.e., Is this effort similar to the baseline used for the calculations? Is the baseline recent? Are the calculations
statistically accurate? Has any upgrade to offeror production equipment been considered, etc?
3.8.2.6 When comparing hours with those proposed by other contractors, the TOMA must make allowances for different
methods of documenting and allocating labor and hours. The TOMA may want to consult with other PM or staff experts in
this area.
3.8.2.7 There are two components of completeness; complete justiﬁcation of costs and complete coverage of require-
ments. Costs in this instance are primarily labor hours, with the addition of travel, reproduction, and similar dollar costs.
3.8.2.8 The coverage of offeror proposed efforts must be assessed by comparing the proposal with the RFP scope and
effort. Of critical importance are the data rights proposed. Data rights should support future changes in support and
operating concepts. If the program is totally funded by the government, the TOMA should propose unlimited rights to all
technical data developed for the program. During this portion of the evaluation, the TOMA may discover that the RFP is
misleading or incomplete or unneeded requirements have been included. In this case, the TOMA must notify the PCO so that
offerors have the opportunity to modify proposals.
3.8.2.9 The TOMA should provide the PCO with an estimate of contract risk (high or low), based on the scope, period,
and technical requirements of the RFP. Higher risk technologies would justify higher percentage proﬁts. For example, is the
overall program established or leading edge technology? What percentage is new development versus modiﬁcation or
off-the-shelf? How long is the contract period? Are the TOs traditional page-based formats or IETM/S1000D based TOs?
3.8.2.10 Offeror ability to comply with program requirements may be assessed by comparing the offeror proposal with the
evaluation factors and criteria (did the proposal indicate a complete understanding of the effort involved?) by reviewing
CPARs of past performance on similar contracts, by site visits, interviews, and other investigation methods.
3.8.2.11 Reporting the evaluation results is critical. The TOMA must indicate which portion of each proposal is being
evaluated, whether that portion meets the requirements documented in the RFP, whether the RFP has any internal problems,
what must be done to correct any shortfalls, and a risk assessment of offeror ability to perform. Accuracy, brevity and clarity
are the keys to successfully preparing an evaluation report.
3.8.2.12 During evaluation some aspects or provisions of the proposal may appear deﬁcient or require clariﬁcation. If data
provided in the proposal fails to address all contract requirements, is inadequate for a proper evaluation or is contradictory,
an Evaluation Notice (EN) should be submitted through the PCO. ENs must be speciﬁc and limited to the aspect of the
offeror proposal causing the problem.
3.8.3 Contractor Costs. Cost for TO development fall into two categories, direct and indirect. Direct refers to those costs
incurred solely as a result of the TO development effort, such as writing, editing, printing, and so forth. Indirect refers to
costs which would be incurred whether or not TOs were developed, such as company management, facility operation.
3.8.4 Speciﬁc Technical Order Proposal Evaluation Guidelines.
3.8.4.1 Areas Subject to Double Charging. Not all TOs or source data packages require all support functions, and the
offeror proposal should clearly differentiate these items. For example, some commercial manuals do not require supplement-
ing, and the only allowable costs should be for development of an Identifying Technical Publication Sheet (ITPS), purchase
of multiple copies, and administrative processing of the CFE Notices and manual certiﬁcation. If task development is
performed as part of a Supportability Analysis (when on contract), TOs should not also be charged for task development.
3.8.4.2 TO Sizes. The TOMA should estimate page counts (and/or ﬁle lengths, database sizes, etc. for digital TOs) by
comparing the program to existing programs for similar military systems or commodities when possible. For example, is the
offeror proposed number of pages in line with this estimation? If TOs are priced individually or by types, compare the
number of pages proposed with the number of pages in published TOs of the same type for similar equipment.
3-11

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_43
TO 00-5-3
3.8.4.3 Historical Data. If historical data from like systems is not available, the TOMA should solicit inputs from the PM
technical services function.
3.8.4.4 Technical Order Data Rights. The TOMA should assess any areas of the proposal where the Offeror has
proposed less than full rights to the technical data. The key concern is whether the government will have adequate rights to
support the weapon system for its life cycle, including data for alternate repair source selection and competitive spare parts
procurement. The TMCR may require a separately priced option that provides for the government’s rights to a future
delivery of the technical data.
3.8.4.5 Evaluation Assistance. TOMA evaluations should be based on experience and judgment to the maximum extent
possible, using the resources of other TOMAs and the TO IPT. When necessary, ask the offerors speciﬁc questions regarding
their proposals, through the PCO.
3.8.5 Protecting Evaluation and Contract Award. The effectiveness and integrity of the contracting process requires
that all data and information be handled with the utmost discretion to avoid any compromise. All data and information
received or developed during proposal evaluation shall be protected from unauthorized disclosure IAW the FAR and DoDM
5400.07.
3.8.6 Proposal Evaluation and Contract Award. During source selection, contractor proposals will be evaluated using
RFP section M criteria, and will be ranked according to several factors (including such things as past performance, demon-
strated understanding of requirements, and price.) A contract is negotiated and awarded to the winning offeror.
3.8.7 Identiﬁcation of Additional Technical Manual Requirements (Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) Evalua-
tion). Evaluate ECPs, associated TCTOs, and Contract Change Proposals (CCPs) against the baseline contract to ensure
costs correspond to the original proposal and were not included in the baseline costs. Some TO updates as a result of ECPs
should be included in the routine periodic update program, and some proposed additions to the number of TOs developed or
acquired may be included in contract baselines. Evaluate the ECPs/CCPs against similar items previously submitted by the
contractor.
3.9 TO DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.
3.9.1 General Guidelines. The TO development process is managed by the TOMA within the framework of a TO
program. The conferences, reviews and veriﬁcation activities conducted by the TOMA are an essential and formal process
helping to ensure the data developed meets the needs of the users within the program scope. Attendance at these TO
development activities must be limited to the minimum number of personnel required to accomplish the purpose of the
conference or review. Personal preference must not affect requirements. After the program contract is signed, any modiﬁca-
tions to requirements noted during these conferences and reviews must be documented for PCO action. Minutes of proceed-
ings are not authorization to change contracts.
3.9.1.1 Involvement. The TOMA shall be involved in all aspects of the acquisition program, as there are very few areas
that will not affect TO and source data development. The TOMA should participate in such non-TO program meetings as
logistics and program management reviews, supportability and provisioning conferences, Preliminary and Critical Design
Reviews (PDR and CDR), and Support Equipment Recommendation Data (SERD) Reviews.
3.9.1.2 Preparation. The TOMA shall be prepared to discuss TO issues at logistics and program management reviews. In
addition, the TOMA will assess and coordinate changes to schedules and availability of equipment to support future TO
events.
3.9.1.3 Participation. In addition to agencies listed above, participation should include local Defense Contract Manage-
ment Agency (DCMA) personnel. Air Force attendees should be officers and/or E6-E9 enlisted personnel or civilian equiva-
lents. AF attendees should be familiar with Air Force and MAJCOM TO acquisition and system support policies. All
participants should understand applicable TMSS, publications, functions, and contract requirements. Conference members
must have the authority to make rapid, objective and logical decisions based on contract requirements and Air Force and
MAJCOM policies.
3.9.2 Initial Technical Order Guidance Conference. The IPT, with the contractor included, will hold an Initial TO
Guidance Conference where program plans are reviewed and approved, and schedules are established. The timing is usually
within 60 days after contract award to avoid delaying contractor tasks. The contractor can initiate TO preparation after the
TO guidance conference. This conference is the most critical because it establishes a ﬁrm understanding between the AF and
3-12

TO 00-5-3
the contractor of what the TO effort will involve and how the program will be executed. The AF contracting officer is an
essential player in this conference in order to ensure that any changes to the requirements are captured, and the contract is
modiﬁed before work can begin on the program. Most new technical order programs can avoid long term problems by
successfully completing an Initial TO Guidance Conference and ensuring both the AF and the contractor fully understand the
TO requirements and the expectations of each party. The results of the conference will be fully documented by contractor
minutes, and coordinated with IPT members. The TOMA will approve and publish the minutes and summarize conference
ﬁndings and action items.
3.9.2.1 The TO Guidance Conference is co-chaired by the TOMA and contractor to ensure understanding of the contract
requirements. The TOMA briefs on the purpose, objectives, scope and functions of the conference and clariﬁes requirements,
plans, and schedules. At this time the TOMA may provide the TOLCMP to the contractor. Speciﬁc agenda items should
include a review of the contract to ensure mutual understanding of the requirements; a review of applicable speciﬁcations
and established Air Force TO policy; a review of basic planning data to ensure mutual understanding of the program and
intended users requirements; and establishment of contacts to provide subsequent guidance and information.
3.9.2.2 Requirements that were not fully deﬁned or could not be deﬁned until hardware selection and applicable operation
and maintenance concepts had been analyzed will be ﬁnalized during the TO Guidance Conference. Any changes affecting
contract performance or costs must be approved by the PCO.
3.9.2.3 Objectives. Guidance Conference objectives are to clarify TO tasks and planning data resulting from contract and
program requirements. Participants will review the military system or commodity support plan, Air Force operation and
maintenance concepts, Air Force TO policy and intended user capabilities, needs or environment. When required, the TOMA
will provide speciﬁcation interpretation and comments on contractor plans and schedules presented as part of the proposal.
Speciﬁc agenda items should be coordinated well before the conference to ensure maximum utility and productivity.
3.9.3 Technical Order Numbering.
3.9.3.1 It is the responsibility of the TOMA to request and assign TO numbers early in the TO acquisition program.
TOMAs are responsible for requesting numbers for assigned TOs, using the ETIMS Request TO Number screen and the
guidance in TO 00-5-18. As Preliminary TOs are developed, the TOMA shall index them in ETIMS so prospective users can
begin establishing subscriptions. This includes IETM/S1000D based TOs. For each new TO category, the TOMA will
establish a TCTO Series Header and electronic TCTO (eTCTO) Series Header for the program’s TOs. Whenever a paper
TCTO series header is requested and created, a corresponding electronic TCTO (eTCTO) series header should be requested
and created.
NOTE
• TO Numbering Functional Users Guides are located on the Air Force Technical Order Manager SharePoint site
at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. Information required to establish new or update TO Numbers is contained
in the Functional Users Guides.
• Refer to Figure 3-1 for TO Numbering and Indexing Flow Chart.
• EOD TOs are not numbered and indexed in ETIMS (Reference Chapter 7 and 00-5-18).
• Only select, Nuclear Weapon Center TOs are currently indexed in ETIMS.
3.9.3.2 TOMAs will develop TO titles IAW FUG https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. An accurate title is an essential
element in determining the correct TO number.
3.9.3.3 All media TO numbers being requested will be completed in ETIMS Request TO Number screen using the
numbering criteria IAW TO 00-5-18 and approved by AFLCMC/LZPTP-TINKER. TO numbering requests have mandatory
entries; Proponent; Publication Type; TO Number; Title; TO Manager; Prime System Application; Functional System; and
FSC. All requests for publication of new TOs in Category 00 must be coordinated with HQ AFMC/A4F by AFLCMC/
LZPTP-TINKER. See Paragraph 3.9.3.6, Paragraph 3.9.3.7 and Paragraph 3.9.3.8 for numbering procedures with AFMET-
CAL, NWC and EOD TOs.
3.9.3.4 Once the USAF TO Numbering Specialist reviews and approves the requested TO number, the TOMA shall enter
additional information about the TO into the newly established ETIMS Catalog record for the TO.

Instructions for the Interservicing of Technical Manuals and Related Technology Program. TMs for joint-service use will list
the owning proponent service’s TM/TO number on the title page ﬁrst, followed by the participating service’s TM/TO
numbers. TMs/TOs which are not widely used by one service are managed in the owning service’s TM system. See TO

3.9.3.6 AFMETCAL is responsible for numbering calibration TOs for Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment
(TMDE).
3.9.3.7 AFNWC/NCL Technical Support Flight (NCLS) is responsible for providing 11N TO numbers for new or renum-
bered nuclear TOs.
3.9.3.8 Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head EOD Technology Division (NSWC IHEODTD) is responsible for
providing numbers for joint service nonnuclear EOD TOs.
3.9.3.9 TCTO Numbering. TOMAs responsible for a new aircraft, missile or engine category must create a new TCTO
Series header. All others should create TCTO Series headers as necessary. TOMAs must use the ETIMS Request TO Number
screen to request a new TCTO series header be established. (Refer to TO 00-5-1 and TO 00-5-18). An eTCTO series header
must always be established and a corresponding physical TCTO series header should also be established if physical media
TCTOs are to be distributed. If TOMAs are providing both physical and electronic TCTO/eTCTOs concurrently for the same
TCTO Header, extra steps must be taken. Since the ETIMS system starts all TCTO numbers at 501, the ﬁrst of a series will
always start with that number and continue. If a TOMA has an established paper series header and establishes a new,
matching electronic series header, when the next TCTO/eTCTO is added, the numbers will not match. The eTCTO will be
added as 501, then be renumbered to match the corresponding paper TCTO number by submitting a Field Support Center
ticket. All eTCTOs will be correct from that point forward.
3.9.3.10 AFNWC/NI is responsible for requesting TCTO numbering outside of ETIMS through AFLCMC/LZPTP-TIN-
KER.
3.9.3.11 TO/TCTO Indexing. When a new TO number is approved or a TO update is generated, the TOMA will:
3.9.3.11.1 Complete ETIMS Index information on new TO number. Improper or incomplete index data will prevent
viewing TO index data in the TO Catalog, subscribing to or requisitioning the TO using ETIMS. Ensure the TO Record is
referenced to the weapon system Mission Design Series (MDS) (if applicable) and equipment part numbers. See ETIMS
Indexing FUG on AF TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. Additional policy-mandated entries in-
clude the document classiﬁcation, assigned Distribution Statement codes and primary Reason codes.
3.9.3.11.2 If the weapon system is not listed, use the Open Weapon System Chooser in the Manage Tech Order Detail
screen to add weapon system. If the weapon system does not already exist, a Field Support Center ticket must be submitted
to add a new weapon system. AF TOFST shall provide the new weapon system name to AFLCMC/WFNB after adding. If
the equipment and/or part number is not listed, use the Maintain Equipment List process to enter data about a new equipment
item.
3.9.3.11.3 Anytime a TO is updated to cover additional equipment, the ITIES information must be updated with the
complete new part number. See FUG https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. The data is used to set up and change the TO
number to equipment number cross-reference data in the ETIMS Catalog.
3.9.3.11.4 Do NOT enter JUST the weapons system MDS (e.g. F100 or B2) for TOs covering component assemblies or
Support Equipment (SE) for the end item. Use the component/SE part numbers from the TO title.
3.9.3.11.5 For General and MPTOs which do not cover speciﬁc weapon systems or equipment, use N/A in both the
Weapon System Chooser and Maintain Equipment List processes.
3.9.3.11.6 Issue unclassiﬁed updates to classiﬁed TOs whenever possible. When indexing unclassiﬁed updates to a clas-
siﬁed TO, TOMA must ﬁrst index the updates in ETIMS, which will assign the parent TO classiﬁcation to the update. Then
the TOMA must change the classiﬁcation of the unclassiﬁed update only to unclassiﬁed.

TO 00-5-3
3.9.4 Technical Order In-Process Reviews. During TO preparation, the IPT conducts In-Process Reviews (IPRs) to
evaluate progress and compliance with contractual requirements. TO format and content requirements are imposed by the
contract. Safety and health reviews will be included in IPRs. The contractor will apply quality management principles to
ensure TO adequacy and accuracy during the development process. See Table 3-1.
3.9.4.1 Scheduling and Purpose. The contractor will recommend the frequency and percentage of IPRs needed for TO
development insight. IPRs are an essential part of the TO QA process. IPRs are scheduled by the contractor in coordination
with the TOMA and are conducted by the TO IPT. IPRs ensure compatibility with engineering source materials, accuracy of
descriptive data, and that TO content, style and format are IAW applicable speciﬁcations and other contractual requirements.
In addition, IPRs are an opportunity for the IPT to identify issues concerning depth of coverage, missing data, data that
needs ampliﬁcation, etc., and for coordination and approval procedures for updates.
3.9.4.2 As a general rule, IPRs should be accomplished when the TOs are 30-40 percent and 70-80 percent complete. See
Table 3-1. Sample In-Process Review completion guides are provided to determine TO completion percentages. In some
cases (e.g., nuclear weapons TOs, certain critical procedures, etc.), a 100 percent IPR may be required. If initial IPRs
indicate that the contractor understands the requirements and is producing a quality product, the contract may be modiﬁed to
reduce the numbers of additional IPRs. For IETM/S1000D based TOs the data will be reviewed online and shall be
conducted through use of the viewing system selected to support the IETM/S1000D based TOs. Comments and corrections
will be captured and recorded electronically. The speciﬁc IETM/S1000D IPR methods and procedures shall be documented
in the TOLCMP.
3.9.4.3 Focus and Support. For earlier IPRs, the primary focus should be on style, format, and planned depth of
coverage. Air Force attendees should be officers and/or E6-E9 enlisted personnel or civilian equivalent, with knowledge of
TO style and format requirements, parent organization policies, and organization signature authority. For later IPRs, the
focus shifts to the technical content and comprehensibility of the manual, and personnel should also include technicians of
the lowest skill level (5-level minimum) expected to operate or maintain the commodity in the ﬁeld.
3.9.4.4 If during the IPR the manual being reviewed does not meet the criteria for completion, the manual may be
rejected. If the manual is rejected, the reasons for rejection must be documented in the meeting minutes along with the
corrective actions required. Once the corrective actions have been completed, the contractor shall notify the TOMA that the
corrections have been completed or adjudicated. The TOMA will determine if another full IPR is required with the IPT or
may determine that the corrections are adequate to move the manual on to the next milestone. These procedures and
processes shall be covered in the TOLCMP.
3.9.5 Contractor Certiﬁcation Process. The contractor certiﬁcation process will be detailed in the proposal submitted in
response to the RFP. The proposed process may be modiﬁed if necessary during contract negotiations, and when approved,
becomes part of the ﬁnal contract. The decision to place the process on contract is made by the government IPT based on
assessed risk, including contractor past performance and existing TO certiﬁcation procedures. Approved certiﬁcation require-
ments must also be applied to any products or processes supplied by vendors or subcontractors. The contractor certiﬁcation
process shall also be attached to the TOLCMP, if available.
NOTE
Procedures and source data developed organically by the Air Force do not require certiﬁcation, but must be
veriﬁed prior to incorporation into a TO.
3.9.5.1 Certiﬁcation Requirements. The contractor is responsible for the end result of the TO development process; that
is, for delivery of adequate, safe, current and accurate TOs which conform to government requirements. The data must be
fully compatible in depth and scope with the established maintenance concept and the approved logistics support plan. The
data must be checked for security classiﬁcation, distribution restrictions, and Reading Grade Level (RGL). The contractor
might use any or all of the previously mentioned procedures as part of their TO certiﬁcation management process. These
requirements also apply to sustainment contracts.
3.9.5.2 Performance Certiﬁcation. When the proposed certiﬁcation process includes task performance, the following
guidance will be followed:
3.9.5.2.1 Nondestructive malfunctions may be introduced for the purpose of checking procedural and fault isolation tasks
or systems tests. Procedures which could cause damage to the hardware or injury to personnel should be simulated.
3-15

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_47
TO 00-5-3
3.9.5.2.2 Only support equipment listed in the TO should be used in testing procedures. The TOMA will be consulted if
substitution of support equipment is required. The contractor must identify and request any Government Furnished Equip-
ment (GFE) required to support the TO development effort. The TOMA will coordinate with applicable PMs, if necessary, to
provide GFE and ensure the equipment will be available to support the weapon system or commodity in the operational
environment.
3.9.5.2.3 Locally fabricated tools or test equipment listed in the TO should be used during testing. Procedures for fabri-
cating these items shall be included in the TOs.
3.9.5.2.4 Tasks will normally be performed at the contractor facility during system or commodity development testing. If
required GFE is not available, tasks may be performed at an operational or test site when approved by the procurement/
sustainment managing activity. The contractor will coordinate requirements with any affected agencies.
3.9.5.2.5 When the contractor cannot perform some tasks due to non-availability of GFE resources, the TOMA shall be
notiﬁed. The TOMA may provide the required resources (if available) to the contractor or suggest use of a ﬁeld location. In
some cases, combining contractor certiﬁcation with AF veriﬁcation may be authorized. As a last resort, the TOMA may
authorize use of simulation or desktop analysis of the procedures.
3.9.5.2.6 Task performance or simulation may be unnecessary for existing manuals and source data that is applicable to
the current conﬁguration of the equipment, if a desktop analysis or publication review proves the manuals are current,
adequate, accurate, and conform to contract requirements.
3.9.5.2.7 QA requirements for Category 11N nuclear weapons TOs are in TO 11N-1-1, Joint Nuclear Weapons Publica-
tion System Operating Procedures, Speciﬁcations and Standards . EOD source data procedures only require contractor
desktop analysis; the government will perform any procedures requiring veriﬁcation.
3.9.6 Veriﬁcation. Veriﬁcation is the formal process by which Air Force personnel evaluate and prove TOs and TO
updates during acquisition and sustainment are accurate, adequate, safe, and usable in the operational environment to support
the program. Current Air Force policy requires that all tasks in TOs and TO updates be 100 percent veriﬁed and that all new
and updated technical data will be veriﬁed unless waived by the PM IAW AFI 63-101 and this TO. This includes data that
has been formalized and is in the sustainment phase of the TO life cycle. Technical data for Contractor Logistics Support
programs need not be veriﬁed unless the data will be used by government personnel.
3.9.6.1 Scheduling. The TOMA will work with the MAJCOM to develop a veriﬁcation schedule that accounts for the
overall availability of trained technicians and production conﬁgured assets to conduct veriﬁcation. Furthermore, veriﬁcations
should be completed in sufficient time to permit correction, publication, and distribution of formal TOs to ﬁeld operations
prior to or concurrent with delivery of the hardware and software to support Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E). When
this is not possible, with command approval, use Interim Contractor Support or authorize use of partially-veriﬁed PTOs until
veriﬁcation can be completed (Reference Paragraph 3.9.6.2). Additionally, the TOMA shall ensure the TOLCMP reﬂects the
latest TO veriﬁcation schedule.
3.9.6.2 Use of PTOs. The TOMA, with approval from the PM in coordination with the Lead Command or Depot, may
issue a waiver to distribute PTOs to operational units or depot repair facilities for veriﬁcation using production equip-
ment. The use of preliminary data shall not exceed 180 days unless readdressed.
3.9.6.3 Partly-Veriﬁed TOs. The inability to verify certain speciﬁc maintenance procedures, such as aircraft wing or
missile canister removal and replacement should not delay formalization and distribution of TOs. If a partly-veriﬁed TO is
issued, the TO will include a Veriﬁcation Status Page (VSP) or screen, and the ﬁrst ﬁeld unit or depot facility required to use
an unveriﬁed procedure will perform using command veriﬁcation IAW TO 00-5-1. Other reasons for issuing partly veriﬁed
TOs include lack of equipment or other required support to perform veriﬁcation. When the destructive nature of the
procedures prevents veriﬁcation by performance, use simulation or desktop analysis IAW Paragraph 3.9.7.2 or Paragraph
3.9.7.3.
3.9.6.4 TO Life Cycle Veriﬁcation Plan (TOLCVP). Veriﬁcation is accomplished IAW the TOLCVP using PTOs pro-
vided by the contractor. The TOMA is responsible for keeping the TOLCVP updated and coordinated throughout the
program life cycle. Find the generic TOLCVP on the AF TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
3-16

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_48
TO 00-5-3
3.9.6.5 Participation. Participation in veriﬁcation efforts by MAJCOM and other affected agency personnel is critical to
the development of TOs. Veriﬁcation activities will not be halted due to lack of attendance by other support agency
personnel.
3.9.6.6 Contractor Support. Contractor support for the veriﬁcation effort should be part of every contract for the acqui-
sition and/or sustainment of TOs. The support usually consists of a writer and/or engineer. This support is required to
minimize delays caused by faulty procedures, lack of spare parts, etc.
3.9.6.7 Veriﬁcation Waivers. The TOMA, with approval of the PM, may waive veriﬁcation by performance/simulation
when procedures are similar to other, previously-veriﬁed procedures on like equipment. The waiver will be documented on
the AFTO Form 27, Preliminary Technical Order (PTO) Publication Change Request (PCR)/TO Veriﬁcation Record/Ap-
proval, or on the form creating a TO update. Veriﬁcation of minor updates to previously-veriﬁed procedures may be
accomplished by simulation or Desk-Top Analysis, whichever the TOMA and TCM deem more appropriate, without a
waiver.
3.9.6.8 Use of Substitute Items. The TOMA or Veriﬁcation Team Manager (VTM) may authorize the use of substitute
equipment, facilities, or draft procedures. This authorization may be given when the required items are not available and
there will be no appreciable difference in procedures. Any such substitution must be coordinated and documented on the
AFTO Form 27, the form creating a TO update or in the veriﬁcation minutes.
3.9.6.9 MAJCOM Responsibilities. Both the technicians for the veriﬁcation team and the site for veriﬁcation are nor-
mally provided by the MAJCOM. The selection of qualiﬁed MAJCOM personnel to perform veriﬁcation depends on the
type and level of maintenance established for the military system or commodity being covered. Different teams and veriﬁ-
cation locations may be required to cover all maintenance types and levels (on- or off-equipment, ﬁeld or depot) for TO
veriﬁcation. The veriﬁcation team will normally consist of the VTM, technicians, QA and Safety personnel, other support
agency personnel, and the contractor. The technicians should include the lowest grade and skill level (5-level minimum)
projected for day-to-day use of the TO. The MAJCOM may use support contractors as part of the government team.
3.9.6.10 Prioritization. The veriﬁcation schedule must be prioritized based on critical operational and maintenance tasks
that affect safety, operational readiness and supportability of the system and commodity during initial deployment. Person-
nel, hardware, consumables and support equipment will be scheduled to ensure availability for each veriﬁcation effort.
3.9.6.10.1 First priority for veriﬁcation is organizational-level operation and maintenance procedures. Within this group-
ing, procedures are further prioritized as follows:
• Pilots and/or Operators Manuals
• All Safety of Flight and Operations procedures
• All Critical Safety precautions
• All TOs required for Nuclear and/or Flight Certiﬁcation
• Day-to-day maintenance and operational tasks in O&M TOs and checklists
• All newly-developed Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) TOs used in support of the above TOs and procedures
• All remaining TOs and procedures
3.9.6.10.2 Second priority is intermediate and depot level maintenance procedures. Depot TO veriﬁcation should be
performed in conjunction with depot prototype overhaul certiﬁcation to the maximum extent possible. This will ensure that
test equipment, software and TOs are compatible, and will reduce the overall cost of the program.
3.9.6.10.3 New and updated non-procedural data veriﬁcation will also be prioritized, as listed below. The PM, SCM or
designee may waive veriﬁcation of non-procedural data based on priority and risk - the waiver will be documented on an
AFTO Form 27 or the document generating an update.
• Safety-related items (Warnings, Cautions, protective gear, etc.)
3-17

--------------------------------------------------

TO 00-5-3
• Tool and equipment part numbers
• Consumable item part numbers
• Repair parts lists
• Work Unit Codes
• Theory of Operations
• Correction of typos, references, etc.
3.9.6.11 Combining Contractor Certiﬁcation and Veriﬁcation. Contractor certiﬁcation and Air Force veriﬁcation pro-
cesses may be combined when the following conditions exist and the option is approved by the PM and MAJCOM:
3.9.6.11.1 Formally resolve the question of liability for damage to equipment or injury to personnel between the contrac-
tor and the government before joint performance of procedures. The contractor is responsible for any damages or injuries
caused by following faulty procedures. Establish a negotiation process to resolve and document any disputes over liability
during the combined effort (request assistance from the Contract Law Office if necessary).
3.9.6.11.2 Tasks should be reviewed for the complexity and hazardous nature of the procedures. Highly complex or
hazardous procedures should be certiﬁed by the contractor prior to delivery for veriﬁcation. Each case must be evaluated and
agreed upon by the PM and MAJCOM.
3.9.6.11.3 MAJCOM personnel will perform the TO procedures with the guidance and assistance of contractor techni-
cians.
3.9.6.11.4 The procedures must be in ﬁnal deliverable format.
3.9.6.12 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technical Orders. Category 60 Joint Service EOD publications for U.S. non-
nuclear and foreign explosive ordnance are developed by the NSWC IHEODTD. EOD publications will be accepted as valid
for Air Force use upon completion of veriﬁcation and publishing on the Joint EOD Portal and in JEOD MFK software
(indicating acceptance by the Military Technical Acceptance Board). AFCEC/CXE manages Air Force participation in the
veriﬁcation program for EOD publications.
3.9.6.13 Nuclear Weapons TOs. Any TO issued under JNWPS will be veriﬁed IAW TO 11N-1-1. The appropriate TCM
from the AF Nuclear Weapons Center, (AFNWC Paragraph 2.8), must participate in the veriﬁcation.
3.9.6.14 Nonnuclear Munitions and Explosives TOs. The USAF GACP (Paragraph 2.6.3) must participate in veriﬁca-
tion of procedures involving nonnuclear munitions and explosives components. The USAF GACP ASC must participate in
veriﬁcation of air superiority missile system TOs (except AGM-65 Maverick, which falls under the GACP).
3.9.6.15 Exemptions. COTS publications and those O&M TOs and source data speciﬁcally approved by the TOMA are
exempt from veriﬁcation by performance. TOs for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) are exempt from AF veriﬁcation.
3.9.6.16 Calibration Technical Orders. Veriﬁcation of 33K TOs will be performed by assigned ﬁeld-level Precision
Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMEL) within 45 days after receiving the commercial manual or PTO, as directed by
AFMETCAL.
3.9.6.17 Minor Sustainment Updates. Veriﬁcation of minor sustainment updates, including minor changes to procedural
data, may use the simpliﬁed Using Command Veriﬁcation procedures in TO 00-5-1. These procedures may be used for either
ﬁeld or depot level TOs.
3.9.6.18 Flight Manual Veriﬁcation Policies. The TOMA and FMM must ensure new or modiﬁed ﬂight manual data is
veriﬁed as soon as possible to ensure ﬂight crew members do not operate aircraft without proper ﬂight manual data IAW AFI
11-215 and AFI 63-101. Preliminary Flight Manual data should only be used for the purpose of veriﬁcation. If Preliminary
3-18

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_50
TO 00-5-3
Technical Orders/Flight Manuals must be used operationally they shall be veriﬁed and must be in a format usable by air
crews. Red-line or mark-up data shall not be used for operational purposes. Ensure draft/preliminary ﬂight manual data is
available a minimum of 30 days prior to delivery of new or modiﬁed equipment/aircraft to allow for veriﬁcation and
training.
3.9.7 Veriﬁcation Methods. Veriﬁcation can take any one or a combination of three acceptable methodologies for accom-
plishment, depending on the type of equipment or instructions being veriﬁed.
3.9.7.1 Performance. Actual performance on production-conﬁgured hardware or government-approved inert versions
(for explosive items) is the only acceptable means to verify certain tasks. Tasks to be veriﬁed by performance include, but
are not limited to, all operating and maintenance procedures.
3.9.7.2 Simulation. In some instances, actual hands on demonstration of procedures duplicates similar tasks already
demonstrated, needlessly subjects equipment to damage, activates one-time items such as Electro-Explosive Devices (EED)
or exposes the technician to personal injury. In these cases, the procedures may be simulated by observing the operational
conﬁguration of the equipment while studying the task to ensure that procedures are logical, effectively descriptive and can
be accomplished.
3.9.7.3 Desktop Analysis. Desktop analysis involves side-by-side comparisons of source data with TO data (text, links,
illustrations, etc.). Non-procedural data and any procedural data where veriﬁcation by performance/simulation has been
waived will be veriﬁed by desktop analysis. Desktop analysis is usually performed during IPRs or (especially during
sustainment) pre-publication reviews. When an IPR is waived or new data is incorporated after the IPR, a separate desktop
veriﬁcation will be required.
3.9.8 Veriﬁcation Procedures. Speciﬁc veriﬁcation procedures for the system under development shall be documented in
the TOLCVP.
3.9.8.1 Veriﬁcation Site. The site selected for any particular veriﬁcation effort will be jointly determined by the TOMA or
TCM and MAJCOM/Depot Maintenance Activity, based on the availability of support functions, the type of procedure being
veriﬁed, the level of maintenance, etc. The site should provide facilities as similar as possible to the operational locations
where the TO procedures will be used.
3.9.8.2 Veriﬁcation Team Manager (VTM). The TOMA or TCM will act as, or task the MAJCOM to appoint a VTM to
control veriﬁcation. Speciﬁc roles and responsibilities of the VTM shall be documented in the TOLCVP. The VTM will
coordinate with all affected agencies to ensure the availability of facilities, equipment and personnel to conduct the veriﬁ-
cation. When the data or procedures are delivered and all required hardware, support equipment, personnel, supplies and data
are available, the VTM will schedule and supervise the veriﬁcation effort, including pre- and post-veriﬁcation meetings.
3.9.8.3 Pre-Veriﬁcation Meeting. The VTM will conduct a pre-veriﬁcation meeting with the veriﬁcation team to ensure
team members are aware of responsibilities and duties. Subjects to be covered during the meeting include the maintenance
concept, any reference documentation available, the speciﬁc TOs and procedures to be veriﬁed, safety precautions, docu-
mentation required and individual team member assignments. Team members will review the procedures prior to beginning
any task veriﬁcation.
3.9.8.4 Veriﬁcation Tasks. The VTM will supervise the actual veriﬁcation effort. The VTM will make every effort to
resolve problems on-site to prevent delaying or canceling veriﬁcation. Checklists will be veriﬁed simultaneously with the
parent manual. A separate AFTO Form 27 will be completed on each TO or portion of a TO and checklist veriﬁed to
document discrepancies and the overall results of the veriﬁcation. The TO VSP will be updated to reﬂect the veriﬁed status.
Veriﬁcation of TO updates may be recorded on the document creating the update (AFTO Form 22, 252 or AF Form 847).
Veriﬁcation of ETMs and IETMs/S1000D based TOs must be performed on the electronic viewing devices (e-tools) desig-
nated for operational use. Speciﬁc veriﬁcation tasks include:
3.9.8.4.1 Performing the procedures to verify usability by personnel with the planned skills and training, ensuring the
arrangement of material and method of presentation support the operations or maintenance concept.
3.9.8.4.2 Observing and reporting any safety violations or hazardous conditions. STOP operations if necessary.
3.9.8.4.3 Performing TO RGL computations, if not documented by the contractor.
3-19

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_51
TO 00-5-3
3.9.8.4.3.1 When a TO is developed organically or when updates meet the criteria speciﬁed herein, government personnel
will document RGL checks using the AFTO Form 124, Computation of Technical Order Reading Grade Level. A copy of
the AFTO Form 124 or contractor equivalent will be included in the TO documentation package for each TO maintained by
the TOMA.
3.9.8.4.3.2 RGL computations may be computer-generated or performed manually using any accepted computation pro-
cedure. The actual RGL can be computed automatically by many word processing and publishing software packages. If
online resources are used, the web address and method used should be included in the RGL documentation for review and
ﬁling. Computations will be reviewed during IPRs.
3.9.8.4.4 Ensuring all actions and suggested or required TO changes are fully documented.
3.9.8.5 Veriﬁcation Updates. The TOMA must ensure updates due to veriﬁcation are accomplished on an expedited
basis. Expedited updates should be restricted to those of a technical nature affecting operation and maintenance procedures.
Expedited editorial changes will be restricted to those affecting comprehensibility. Changes based on personal preference
must be submitted through the normal TO change process.
3.9.8.6 Post-Veriﬁcation Meeting. The VTM will conduct a post-veriﬁcation meeting to resolve any problems, generate
the minutes, and assign action items as required. VSPs will be updated as required. The Veriﬁcation Record section of an
AFTO Form 27 will be used to document any discrepancies found in the TO or procedures during veriﬁcation, and recom-
mend either further veriﬁcation or formalization of the TO. The form will be submitted to the TOMA (or TO Review Board
(TORB)/Flight TORB (FTORB)) for approval. When approved by the TOMA, the AFTO Form 27 recommending formal-
ization will be used as authority to prepare the formal TO. Discrepancies found during veriﬁcation of TO updates may be
recorded on the document creating the update. The program CE or equivalent will approve veriﬁcation results for TO
updates.
3.9.8.7 Veriﬁcation Review Boards. All comments and changes developed as a result of veriﬁcation must be approved
by a review panel, normally a TORB or FTORB, prior to incorporation in the TO. This review panel should consist of
personnel from activities involved in the acquisition or modiﬁcation program, as determined by the TOMA and documented
in the TOLCVP, including veriﬁcation team members and the contractor. The ﬂight manual review panel must include at
least three rated officers. After review, coordination and approval, the changes will be sent to the contractor for update of the
TO involved, and if veriﬁcation was completed successfully, preparation of the formal manual. Review boards are not
required for TO updates provided the CE approves the changes.
3.9.8.8 Veriﬁcation Documentation. Each veriﬁcation effort requires complete documentation, including minutes and
any forms generated. For concurrent contractor/government testing, contractor records will be included with veriﬁcation
documentation. Veriﬁcation activities and results of TOs under development or being updated as part of a modiﬁcation
program will be documented using an AFTO Form 27. (See Chapter 4 for veriﬁcation during sustainment). The TOMA will
maintain a ﬁle of all veriﬁcation documentation issued for the life of the TO covered.
3.9.9 Technical Order Pre-Publication Reviews. The TOMA and IPT will ensure that veriﬁcation comments and cor-
rections are incorporated and that manuals meet contractual requirements. A formal pre-publication (pre-pub) review may be
required. Pre-pub reviews are scheduled and conducted by the TOMA, as called for in the IMP. Pre-pub reviews are an
examination of the master TO or update reproducible ﬁle prior to delivery to ensure incorporation of changes resulting from
veriﬁcation, recommended changes, and as a ﬁnal check on contract compliance. Pre-pubs are not required in every case, the
TOMA decides if one is needed on a TO-by-TO basis, depending on number and complexity of changes from veriﬁcation
contractor performance on updating previous TOs, etc. Every effort should be made to include veriﬁcation team members at
pre-pub reviews to enhance continuity. If necessary, an AFTO Form 158, Technical Order Review Comment Sheet, may be
utilized during the pre-publication review.
3.9.10 Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) and Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS). TCMs/PMs must ensure the
procedures in TOs minimize the generation, use and disposal of HAZMAT and ODS IAW AFPD 32-70 and associated
instructions. Any use of HAZMAT and ODS must be justiﬁed by the contractor and approved by TCM/PM. Materials used
and methods for use of material must comply with AF regulations especially as to effects on health and the environment
(AFOSH STDs and AFI 32-70xx Series).
3.9.11 Contractor Furnished (Aeronautical) Equipment (CFAE/CFE) Notice Processing and Tracking Procedures.
As system or commodity development proceeds, the prime contractor or subcontractors may identify additional hardware
support requirements or components of the end item that require separate or additional TOs for operation and maintenance of
the end item or commodity. CFAE/CFE Notices are normally submitted by contractors when required by a CDRL item, or by
3-20

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_52
TO 00-5-3
other government agencies developing TOs for the Air Force to identify these new or additional TO requirements. The
notices identify the purpose and use of speciﬁc technical manuals for the operation, maintenance and inspection of equip-
ment used with the end-item system or commodity, and which are not already covered by the TO development contract. The
manuals may be MILSPEC TOs, commercial manuals, or contractor data developed for the government.
3.9.11.1 CFAE/CFE Content. CFAE/CFE content is speciﬁed by DID DI-TMSS-80067, Contractor Furnished Aeronau-
tical Equipment/Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFAE/CFE) Notices . Notices should be checked to be sure all blocks are
ﬁlled in (i.e., contract number and date, submitting contractor name and vendor code, publisher name and vendor code, stock
number, conﬁgured item number, etc.) Incomplete or inaccurate notices should be returned to the contractor for corrective
action. CFAE/CFE notices should be revised and resubmitted or superseded whenever the item represented undergoes
signiﬁcant change or data requirements change.
3.9.11.2 Federal Stock Class (FSC). The FSC of the equipment covered is listed on the CFAE/CFE notice. The FSC is
used with the D086, Mission Workload Assignments System, to determine the prime office responsible for management of the
commodity and manual involved.
3.9.11.3 CFAE/CFE Procedures. The TOMA or TCM shall establish a procedure for reviewing and processing CFAE/
CFE inputs. The procedures for processing CFAE/CFE notices shall be documented in the TOLCMP and updated throughout
the program life cycle as needed. The procedure must stipulate who reviews CFAE/CFE notices for each type of document
recommended and who has ultimate approval authority for acceptance and numbering of the recommended documents.
3.9.11.4 CFAE/CFE Approval. Upon approval of a CFAE/CFE notice, the TOMA forwards a letter through the appro-
priate contracting office notifying the contractor of the TO number assigned, title (if other than proposed), license rights and
copyright release statements, quantities required, and shipping instructions (if not covered in the contract TMCR).
3.9.11.5 CFAE/CFE Disapproval. If the CFEN is disapproved, full justiﬁcation must be provided. If the item has been
classiﬁed as a non-reparable or throwaway item, the appropriate PM must be notiﬁed to ensure the equipment is covered in
the supportability analysis database. If disapproval is due to errors in CFAE/CFE notice preparation rather than unnecessary
or unsuitable data, the TOMA should immediately inform the contractor to allow timely revision and resubmittal of a
corrected CFAE/CFE notice to avoid costly delay.
3.9.11.6 Military Speciﬁcation TOs. As system or commodity development proceeds, contractors may identify additional
hardware support requirements or components of the end item that require separate TOs for operation and maintenance of
the item or commodity. For new SE, the contractor may submit a SERD, accompanied by any required CFENs (DI-TMSS-
80067). Contractors may develop their own processes for notifying the government of new SE requirements, as long as all
Logistics Management Information (LMI) required to make accept/reject decisions is provided. For new manuals to support
end item components, only the CFEN is required. CFENs may not be required if all TO requirements can be completely
deﬁned in advance in the contract (usually on less complex projects).
3.9.11.7 CFAE/CFE/CFEN Notice Status. Depending on the number of contractors and volume of COTS data, a
database for each contractor should be maintained with summary pages showing status of each notice, as well as individual
work sheets on each notice providing more detailed information on actions taken.
3.9.11.8 New Support Equipment. For new SE, the contractor will submit a SERD accompanied by any required
CFAE/CFE notice (DI-TMSS-80067). Contractors may develop their own processes for notifying the government of new SE
requirements, as long as all data required to make accept/reject decisions is provided. For new manuals to support end item
components, only the CFAE/CFE notice is required. CFAE/CFE notices may not be required if all TO requirements can be
completely deﬁned in advance in the contract (usually on less complex projects).
3.9.11.9 SERD Review. Each SERD submitted must be reviewed and approved as directed by the PM before the
equipment can be used with the end item. Disapproval of the SERD usually disapproves any associated CFAE/CFE notices.
For approved SERDs and end item components, associated CFAE/CFE notices must be reviewed for applicability, need for
a stand-alone manual, depth of coverage recommended, etc. and approved separately.
3.9.11.10 Contractor Data. In lieu of developing MILSPEC TOs, the contractor may recommend use of in-house con-
tractor format technical data. The CFAE/CFE notices and the data recommended must be reviewed and approved like
commercial manuals.
3-21

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_53
TO 00-5-3
3.9.11.11 Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Manual. When the contractor recommends use of commercially available
SE or end item components, use of manufacturer manuals customarily provided with the commercial article may also be
recommended. Copies of the COTS manuals are attached to the CFEN recommendations for government review and
approval IAW MIL-PRF-32216. CFENs on COTS manuals must include the contractor evaluation of suitability based on
MIL-PRF-32216. See Section V for additional information when working with COTS programs.
3.9.11.12 Developing Supplemental Data. When supplemental data is required to make the manual acceptable, the
contractor should be contacted to determine if the additional data can be obtained from the vendor or if the contractor will
have to develop such data. Depending on the reply, the additional data shall be obtained and the manual returned for
reevaluation. If the required data cannot be obtained from the vendor, a cost estimate for the development of the additional
required data must be provided.
3.9.11.13 COTS Manual Records. Each program must establish a list to track proposed COTS manuals. The list should
include CFAE/CFE Notice numbers, date approved or disapproved (with disapproval reasons), contractor, prime responsible
office, ship dates for the approved manuals, and whether or not the manuals were received at the appropriate destination. A
follow-up letter should be sent to the ALC responsible for the commodity and the supporting manual to ensure receipt and
authorize contractor payment.
3.9.12 Computer Program Identiﬁcation Number (CPIN) Items. Software program tapes and control documentation
will be referenced in TOs using only the basic CPIN. XXX may be used in the last three alpha-numeric position of a CPIN.
Users MUST check the ACPINS compendium for the latest version and revision for their application. CPIN revision/version
shall not be published in TOs without coordination and written approval of the CPIN PM. If revisions/versions are used, the
TOs must be updated on a priority basis to reﬂect changes in the revision/version numbers and dates of programs authorized
for use in the Automated CPIN System (ACPINS).
3.9.13 Other Program Reviews Affecting Technical Manuals.
3.9.13.1 Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews (PDRs and CDRs). PDRs and CDRs address many issues which
affect the TOs. Automatic versus manual testing, maintainability requirements, special tools, unique support equipment, and
special skills are discussed. A common contractor practice is to propose changing TO procedures rather than hardware design
to overcome deﬁciencies. TOs must NOT be used to compensate for design deﬁciencies.
3.9.13.2 Functional and Physical Conﬁguration Audits (FCAs/PCAs). These events are critically important to the
TOMA because they form the basis for establishing the production baseline conﬁguration of the hardware/software items
under development. All technical manuals are required to reﬂect the production baseline and therefore, any program which
schedules TO delivery before these events have been accomplished, is not acceptable.
3.9.13.3 Provisioning Reviews. Provisioning is the process of cataloging all of the parts expected to be procured as
replacement spares throughout the life of the program. This review is critical to the Illustrated Parts Breakdown manual
because the output of the provisioning effort will determine the depth and level to which an item will be repaired or replaced.
The purpose of provisioning activities is to ensure integration of support elements such as production, support equipment,
technical manuals/orders, training, and facilities. The provisioning conference provides for the government to make item
selection and assign technical and management codes. It is imperative that only personnel well qualiﬁed in their technical
specialty attend provisioning conferences and that continuity of personnel be maintained throughout the item development.
In all cases, representatives must be authorized to make commitments for their activity. The TOMA should be involved in
the conference to ensure that official Source, Maintainability and Recoverability (SMR) codes are assigned and are given to
the contractor, through the Contracting Officer, for publication in the IPB or the numerical index of the IPB IAW MIL-DTL-
38807, Technical Manuals, Illustrated Parts Breakdown. See AFMCI 23-101 and the Product Support Tool Kit (PSTK),
(formally known as the A&S Tool Kit) (Paragraph 1.3.3) for additional guidance on provisioning activities and conduct of
the provisioning conference.
3.9.13.4 Supportability Analysis Reviews. The supportability analysis process is a review of tasks performed to exam-
ine all elements of a proposed system to determine the logistics support required for the system; and to inﬂuence the design
so that both the system and support can be provided at an affordable cost. Supportability data is the foundation for identi-
fying and managing support resources including: supplies, support equipment, technical orders, training resources and
conﬁguration management. Supportability data is acquired as part of the technical data package of the weapon system
acquisition and contributes to the sustainment processes: data management and conﬁguration management as well as form-
ing the basis for maintenance and supply. Supportability data links the allocated baseline of the weapon system to the
physical baseline and integrates technical and engineering data with maintenance and supply data and forms the basis for
managing the sustainment of the weapon system. The TOMA should be involved in the supportability review conferences to
3-22

--------------------------------------------------

TO 00-5-3
ensure that the technical reports developed and delivered as part of the supportability analysis reﬂect results of maintenance
task analysis and Reliability Centered Maintenance provide information for selection and development of Source Mainte-
nance and Recovery (SMR) codes, spares, support equipment, technical orders and other related logistics data. This includes
identifying procedures for system disassembly, demilitarization and disposal. Where procedures already exist (e.g. 309th
Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group workbooks and procedures for existing aircraft), the TCM/CE shall review
and verify those procedures. Demilitarization and disposal procedures should identify DEMIL-coded parts and HAZMAT
locations, and include special tools and equipment, personnel qualiﬁcations, and Environmental, Safety and Occupational
Health (ESOH) requirements.

SECTION II TECHNICAL ORDER UPDATES DURING ACQUISITION
3.10 GENERAL.
This section describes acquisition-phase procedures for updating TOs and PTOs during acquisition. Sustainment-phase TO
updating procedures are in Chapter 4. The TOMA is responsible for ensuring that TOs remain current and accurate through-
out the acquisition phase by contracting for TO updates.
3.10.1 RFPs and Contracts. The RFP Instruction to Offerors section must address TO maintenance as a requirement of
the program. The contractor will propose coverage requirements and update cycles. Best practice is to contract for TO
maintenance in renewable options once the initial TO development contract is completed, to allow the Air Force time to
assume the TO maintenance role.
3.10.2 Engineering Change Proposals (ECP). Updates to TOs as a result of an ECP are normally considered to have
the same contractual status as the ECP. In other words, if the ECP is in the scope of the contract, so is the TO update; if the
ECP is out of scope, the cost for updates to the TOs must be included in the ECP costs.
3.10.3 Update Submittal. Updates are submitted on several different forms, known collectively as Recommended Changes
(RC). RCs for PTOs are generally submitted on AFTO Form 27 (Figure 3-2) IAW procedures speciﬁed in the program
TOLCMP. The AFTO Form 27 may also be used in lieu of the AF Form 847 for preliminary Flight Manuals. The TOMA or
3-26

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_58
TO 00-5-3
FMM may specify use of the AFTO Form 22 or AF Form 847 for reporting deﬁciencies on formal TOs and PTOs used by
operational units during program acquisition. The change process to be used during TO development along with the routing
and approvals required shall be documented in the TOLCMP and updated as required throughout the program life cycle.
3.10.4 Update Approval and Incorporation. The TOMA must ensure that all involved agencies are made aware of the
routing and approval requirements. Because the Air Force may not have the capability to perform an engineering evaluation
of suggested changes during acquisition, the contractor is often tasked to provide this support. Normally, a TO Review Board
(TORB) and Flight TO Review Board (FTORB) are established to review, approve and determine veriﬁcation requirements
for all proposed PTO updates. After updates are approved by the TORB/FTORB, the TOMA sends them to the contractor for
incorporation in the affected TO.
3.10.5 Veriﬁcation. All changes to technical data procedures, no matter how they are published shall be veriﬁed by
performance or as otherwise speciﬁed by this TO.
3.11 TYPES OF PRELIMINARY TECHNICAL ORDER UPDATES.
The types of updates used with formal TOs (TO 00-5-1) will also be used with PTOs during acquisition. In addition, an
approved AFTO Form 27 may be inserted into the PTO as an interim update. This would normally be done only in cases of
work stoppage or to eliminate safety hazards. The TOMA must issue an index page with each RC/update to identify all
current updates; the index page will be dated and identify the PTO, updates, and organizations affected.
3.11.1 Procedures for AFTO Form 27. The AFTO Form 27 is the primary vehicle for submitting updates and improve-
ments to PTOs. The AFTO Form 27 will be used by the TO veriﬁcation team, and, when authorized by the TOMA, other
users of PTOs on all programs. The criteria for submitting and processing Emergency, Urgent and Routine AFTO Form 27
are speciﬁed below. Completion instructions are in Figure 3-2.
3.11.2 Use Period. The TOMA is responsible for determining when the AFTO Form 27 will no longer be used to
recommend updates or improvements to PTOs. This is normally after veriﬁcation has been completed. The period of use will
be speciﬁed in the TOLCMP.
3.11.3 Processing AFTO Form 27. RCs and updates are categorized as Emergency, Urgent or Routine. The update
category is based on its impact to the system, mission effectiveness, safety or maintainability. Emergency and Urgent
submittals should be limited to technical and safety-related changes. Change processing and update time limits are speciﬁed
in Table 4-1. Changes to report categories will not be made without the express concurrence of the TOMA and the submit-
ting MAJCOM.
3.11.3.1 Emergency RCs. Emergency recommendations require immediate action on a TO deﬁciency which, if not
corrected, WOULD result in a fatality or serious injury to personnel, extensive damage or destruction of equipment or
property, or inability to achieve or maintain operational posture (MISSION ESSENTIAL), including ﬁeld-level work stop-
page. In addition, emergency includes discrepancies that directly affect the handling, maintenance, operations, transportation,
testing, and testing or storage of nuclear weapons. The TOMA/TCM or designated representative must provide written
corrective action or downgrade the RC within 48 hours (72 hours for work stoppage) of receipt.
3.11.3.2 Urgent RCs. Urgent recommendations require action on a TO deﬁciency which, if not corrected, COULD cause
one or more of the following: personnel injury; damage to equipment or property; reduce operational efficiency, and/or
jeopardize the safety or success of mission accomplishment. Submit RCs that could result in over $25,000 or 1000 man-
hours annual savings to the Air Force as urgent. All technical TCTO deﬁciencies are submitted as urgent. Identiﬁcation of or
replacements for EPA Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) and ODS are submitted as urgent. In addition, urgent includes all
other discrepancies that indirectly affect a nuclear weapon and technical orders that indirectly affect the handling, mainte-
nance, operations, transportation, training, and testing or storage of nuclear weapons.
3.11.3.3 Routine RC. Routine recommendations require action on TO deﬁciencies that do not fall into emergency or
urgent categories.
3.11.4 Airman Powered by Innovation (API) Program. The IDEA program has been renamed to the Airmen Powered
by Innovation (API) program. AFI 38-402, Airman Powered by Innovation (API) Program provides guidance for the API
program. This guidance and procedures apply to ideas submitted as of 1 June 2013. Website reference at https://ipds.afpc-
.randolph.af.mil. Approved reports which could be eligible for submission of an after-the-fact idea will have AFTO Form 22,
Block 18 annotated with the expected tangible or intangible beneﬁts and justiﬁcation.
3-27

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_59
TO 00-5-3
3.11.4.1 Restrictions. After-the-fact APIs may only be submitted on approved routine RCs to PTOs in acquisition if they
provide an improved work procedure or method, such as welding in lieu of fasteners, or local repair instead of discard.
3.11.4.2 Ineligible Updates. RCs identifying errors in TOs or procedures prior to formalization, i.e., wrong screws,
erroneous measurements, incorrect references, typographical errors, etc., are ineligible for the API program. Corrections of
this type are an integral part of the TO development process.
3.11.4.3 Submission. Submit the improvement or enhancement from an approved RC through the Idea Program Data
System (IPDS), attaching a copy of the approved RC to the idea. The API evaluator (normally the same individual who
approved the RC) will determine job responsibility, validate savings/beneﬁts, and recommend approval of the idea. API
beneﬁts must be documented in IPDS when the submittal is made. The IPDS will base the award on the validated RC data.
If the RC is not eligible for an after-the-fact API award, the API evaluator will indicate the reason for disapproval in IPDS.
3.11.5 Disposition. The TOMA or designated representative will forward approved RCs to the contractor for incorpora-
tion in the next update to the PTO or TO.
3.11.6 Interim Update Procedures. If approved routine recommended changes cannot be published within the time
frames of Table 4-1, an Interim Operational Supplement (IOS) will be generated by the TOMA, if requested by the users.
3.12 CONTROL AND TRACKING OF RECOMMENDED CHANGES.
The TOMA must develop a system to track and control RCs from the time requests are received or generated until incor-
poration into the TOs. The TOMA also should address how much outstanding content will be allowed and for how long
before considering preparing a clean WA-1 revision. Speciﬁc items to be recorded include date received/initiated, action
taken, date disapproved or forwarded to contractor, and date incorporated. The method for tracking will be speciﬁed in the
TOLCMP. AFTO Form 27 must be maintained on ﬁle for at least two years, IAW the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule, (https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm).
3.13 CLASSIFIED RECOMMENDED CHANGES.
RCs containing classiﬁed data will be marked with the proper classiﬁcation and appropriate downgrading and declassiﬁca-
tion instructions IAW DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1/ AFI 16-1404. The program Security Classiﬁcation Guide (SCG) will be
referred to when determining if classiﬁed data is included. Unclassiﬁed RCs on classiﬁed TOs will be marked: This is an
unclassiﬁed AFTO Form ____________________ on a classiﬁed manual. Security violations involving TOs will be reported
IAW DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1/ AFI 16-1404, not by use of a RC.
3.14 TECHNICAL ORDER UPDATES DUE TO EQUIPMENT MODIFICATION OR REPLENISHMENT SPARES
PROCUREMENT.
3.14.1 Requirements. New speciﬁcation requirements, modiﬁcations and replenishment spares procurement can result in
new inventory items for replacement or replenishment issue. New TOs may be required and/or existing TOs updated or
rescinded.
3.14.2 Coordination and Advisement. The TCM will coordinate with the reparable assembly or system PM to determine
if safety, life support or critical systems are involved. The TCM and TOMA will identify and advise affected TOMAs, PMs,
SAP users and other DoD agencies (Army, Navy, etc.) of the proposed new or modiﬁed equipment/end item and recommend
updating of affected TOs. Advisement must include known systems or commodities TOs, when stocks of the original
equipment/end item TOs will be exhausted, and speciﬁc TO updates required (if known). Coordination and advisement
requirements are not required for common National Stock Class items (e.g., nuts, bolts, resistors, etc.) unless safety, life
support, or critical systems or material are involved. In conjunction with the TOMA, the TCM will initiate acquisition of
new TOs or TO updates for commodities/equipment/end items under TCM control. Notify the TOMA in writing to rescind
obsolete TOs as required. Keep MAJCOMs informed of the TO status and anticipated publication date(s). Follow up with
the MAJCOM to ensure TO updates are distributed and support requirements of users have been satisﬁed.
3.15 UPDATE DISTRIBUTION AND FILING.
The provisions of TO 00-5-1 do not apply to the distribution of PTO updates or RCs approved for use with PTOs during
acquisition. The TOMA must make arrangements to provide copies of approved updates to all affected users of the PTOs.
RACs, ISSs and IOSs to PTOs will be posted the same as for formal TOs. RCs approved for operational use will be posted
3-28

like Interim TOs. Operational PTO ﬁles will contain only those RCs/updates which apply to that organization; reference ﬁles
may contain all RCs/updates applicable to the command.

SECTION III MINOR ACQUISITION SUSTAINMENT PROGRAMS
3.16 OVERVIEW.
There are a lot of parallels between major acquisition programs and smaller acquisition programs; the main difference is the
overall cost of these programs and the degree to which each type of program relates to the events or milestones. For
example, both types of program will require some degree of acquisition strategy and some acquisition planning, the main
difference is, there is far more planning required for a large aircraft development program, than for a small hydraulic jack
program. Also, many of the smaller programs typically do not require all of the same number of personnel to administer the
program. Major events which have a direct effect on smaller TO programs are included below.
3.16.1 Data Call. Used by Program Offices to solicit requirements for smaller programs. These events replaced the more
structured Data Requirements Review Boards in many instances. The TOMA is a key player along with the IPT members in
determining the scope and depth of each new program. Data calls are an integral part of the requirements development
process.
3.16.2 Technical Manual Contract Requirements (TMCRs). Technical manuals requirements are similar in both Major
and Minor acquisitions. Refer to Paragraph 3.6.1 for a further explanation.
3.16.3 DD Form 1423 - CDRL and CLIN for TOs. See Paragraph 3.6.4 for further explanation.
3.16.3.1 The TOMA may include draft CDRLs for known data requirements in the RFP. The CDRL for TO delivery (if
included), with the TMCR attached, will be referenced in RFP section J. The Instruction to Offerors will require the offerors
to develop SOW paragraphs, complete CDRL tailoring and submit any other suggested data requirement CDRLs with the
proposals.
3.16.3.2 If CDRLs are not included in the RFP, the Instruction to Offerors will require offerors to propose all data
requirements, including TOs. In this case, a partly-tailored TMCR may be placed in either the system speciﬁcation or the
Proposal Technical Library.
3.16.3.3 Justiﬁcation. Offerors must justify each data requirement included in proposals. The TOMA or program data
manager will complete DD Form 1423 (CDRLs) for approved requirements. See DoD 5010.12-M for DD Form 1423
instructions.
3.16.4 Initial TO Guidance Conference/Post Award Conference. Refer to Paragraph 3.9.2.
3.16.4.1 Negotiations. Negotiations can also occur during the performance of the contract for Engineering Change
Proposals (ECP), Contract Change Proposals (CCP), or as a result of differences in contract interpretation. TOMA partici-
pation remains the same whatever the reason for negotiations, and must be performed through the PCO.
3.16.4.2 Additional Evaluations. Evaluate ECPs, associated TCTOs, and CCPs against the baseline contract to ensure
costs correspond to the original proposal and were not included in the baseline costs. Some TO updates as a result of ECPs
should be included in the routine periodic update program, and some proposed additions to the number of TOs developed or
acquired may be included in contract baselines. Evaluate the ECPs/CCPs against similar items previously submitted by the
contractor.
3.16.4.3 Contract Adjustments. If, for any reason, the contractor does not perform some functions as originally proposed
(for example, when schedules are accelerated and revised need dates prevent some quality checks, or vital support equipment
will not be available in time), an equitable adjustment to the contract/order price should be negotiated. The PCO will manage
negotiations and may or may not require TOMA support.
3.16.4.4 Guidance Conference/Post Award Conference. The IPT, with the contractor included, holds a Guidance
Conference or a Post Award Conference where program plans are reviewed and approved, and schedules are established. The
timing is usually within 60 days after contract award to avoid delaying contractor tasks. The contractor can initiate TO
preparation after the TO guidance conference. Refer to Paragraph 3.9.2 for additional information.
3.16.4.5 Management and Scheduling. Refer to Paragraph 3.9.2.

SECTION IV SPECIAL PURPOSE TECHNICAL ORDER REQUIREMENTS
PROGRAMS
3.17 SPECIAL PURPOSE TECHNICAL ORDER REQUIREMENTS.
NOTE
All manuals will be prepared IAW the speciﬁca-
tions and standards stated on the TMCR.
Most weapon system acquisition programs will require procurement of special purpose TOs and source data, requiring
different acquisition and management procedures. These TOs and data require coordination with or even management by
agencies outside the standard process. The types of TOs or source data requiring special treatment include, but may not be
limited to the following:
3.17.1 Aircraft Battle Damage (Assessment and) Repair (ABDR) (-39 Series) TOs. These manuals are developed
IAW MIL-DTL-87158, Manuals, Technical: Aircraft Battle Damage Assessment and Repair, and managed IAW AFI 20-
114, Air and Space Equipment Structural Maintenance.
(Assessment is very seldom used in referring to these TOs.) HQ
AFSC/LGPM, 2704 D St, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7413, DSN 785-6179, is the Air Force OPR for ABDR, and
must be notiﬁed of acquisition activities involving these procedures. Developers may request A4RC-TSO for assistance in
developing procedures.
3.17.2 Nuclear Weapon TOs. The AF Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) is responsible for ICBM, Cruise Missile,
EOD (Category 60N) and speciﬁc aircraft nuclear weapon system TOs. AFNWC Logistics Support Division (NCL) Techni-
cal Support Branch (NCLS) is responsible for the 11N Indexes. The Indexes will identify the responsible TO Management
Agency. All TOs and manuals in the 11N Indexes must be requisitioned through a nuclear TODO account. The TO Man-
agement Agency is responsible for approving release of the TOs under their agency. Applicable AFNWC TOMAs must be
included in all activities related to the acquisition and maintenance of these TOs. (Reference TO 00 5-1, Chapter 10 for
Nuclear TODO Accounts).
3.17.3 Ballistic Missile Codes (21M-XX-16 Series) TOs. The National Security Agency (NSA), Section V62, is the
focal point for the acquisition agency TOMA for Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) launch and targeting codes and
procedures. NSA retains this responsibility for the entire life cycle of the military system. The TOMA shall ensure develop-
mental codes data and procedures are routed to this organization for coordination and approval.

3.17.11 Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) (1-XX-36, 2-XX-9 or 21M-XX-26 Series) TOs and Procedures. These
TOs and NDI procedures will be developed IAW the technical requirements as outlined in TO 33B-1-1 and EN-SB-15-002.
The AF NDI Program Office (AFLCMC/EZPT-NDIO), 4750 Staff Drive, Tinker AFB OK 73145-3317, email: afrl.mls-
ol3@us.af.mil, is the Air Force OPR for the NDI program. The TOMA must contact the Air Force NDI Program Office prior
to initiating contracts for TO development for any military system or commodity, to establish requirements and schedules for
TO development, reviews (including IPRs), and approval. The PM must coordinate an NDI Advisory Board to establish NDI
requirements as speciﬁed by MIL-STD-1530, Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) and AFI 20-114. The Technical
Order developer may contact the Air Force NDI Program Office through the TOMA for assistance.
3.17.12 Work Unit Code (WUC) (-06 Series) Manuals and REMIS Push-Down Tables. System-speciﬁc coding in
these manuals and tables is the responsibility of the prime TCM. HQ AFMC is OPR for the other data elements listed in TO

the PM procures the equipment listing from the contractor, and ensures the codes are assigned.
3.17.13 Critical Alloy and Precious Metals Conservation Procedures and Requirements. The TOMA will acquire
source data for these procedures from the contractor and provide the data to the prime office responsible to develop, prepare,
and publish the 00-25-113-series TOs and changes or supplements required for assigned systems and commodities IAW TO
00-25-113, Critical Alloys and Precious Metal Parts Lists — Gas Turbine Engines. The source data shall conform to TO
00-25-113 requirements.
3.17.14 SEEK EAGLE Certiﬁcation. SEEK EAGLE (AFI 63-104,) is the Air Force program to certify all aircraft and
store conﬁgurations (including weapons, fuel tanks, dispensers, pods, etc.) for loading, safe carriage and employment, and
ballistics accuracy. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO), 46 SK/SKA, 205 West D Avenue, Suite 348, Eglin AFB
FL 32542-6865, monitors this certiﬁcation process. SEEK EAGLE products are source data for inclusion in the aircraft
operational ﬂight program and in Category 1 aircraft and stores TOs. The affected munitions, stores, and aircraft TOMAs
must coordinate with the AFSEO to determine user priorities and which TOs will be speciﬁcally monitored for the SEEK
EAGLE certiﬁcation process. The TOMAs must provide copies of status reports on the selected TOs to the AFSEO, and
ensure that the TOs and/or updates are published in time to meet MAJCOM need dates.
3.17.15 Organic Coatings. When applicable, the TOMA must ensure that source data on new systems is acquired to
update TO 1-1-8, Application and Removal of Organic Coatings, Aerospace and Non-Aerospace Equipment. The OPR is

TO 00-5-3
3.17.20 List of Applicable Publications (LOAPs). This-01 TO type is required for all new and existing weapon and
military systems. It shall be maintained current throughout the system’s life cycle by the TOMA.
3.17.21 Commercial Vehicle Fleet Maintenance Manuals. Whenever the Air Force procures new ﬂeet vehicles, main-
tenance manuals are typically delivered with the new vehicle. Concurrent with the procurement, the manuals will be entered
into the TO system to support TODO subscriptions and one-time requisition requests. Such requests require sponsor ap-
proval justiﬁcation in ETIMS, including:
• Make
• Model
• Air Force Vehicle Registration Number (Tag Number)
• Vehicle Identiﬁcation Number (VIN)
3.17.22 Alternate Mission Equipment (-21) TOs. The -21 TO lists all items authorized for each aerospace vehicle or
missile mission, design, and series (MDS). The TOMA is responsible to ensure that the -21 TO be prepared and updated as
equipment is modiﬁed. The -21 TO is divided into three sections covering three categories of equipment: Section I, Main-
tenance Safety and Protection Equipment (MSPE) used to protect the aerospace vehicle or missile from damage and/or to
make it safe for maintenance. Section II, Alternate Mission Equipment (AME), used to conﬁgure an aerospace vehicle or
missile for one of its optional missions. It can be installed and removed quickly. Section III, Crew and Passenger Support
Equipment (CPSE), used for life support and comfort of crew and passengers.
3.17.23 Aircraft Crew Breathing Systems Using On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS). Aircraft
equipped with On-Board Oxygen Generating System shall develop operating and maintenance procedures for incorporation
into system level TOs IAW MIL-STD-3050, Appendix C Aircraft Crew Breathing Systems Using On-Board Oxygen Gen-
erating System (OBOGS). These maintenance and operating procedure requirements shall be included as part of the tailored
TMCR when applicable.
SECTION V COMMERCIAL OFF THE SHELF (COTS) PROGRAMS
3.18 COTS PROGRAMS.
COTS programs bring a whole new set of challenges to the TO Management system. COTS manuals are generally devel-
oped at contractor expense and are sellable as a commodity item, the USAF must deal with issues, i.e., proprietary data
rights, copyright restrictions, and a myriad of different formats for this type of data. TOMAs cannot assume that just because
the USAF purchased a COTS item, that the government owns the rights to the technical data. Each contractor can set their
own restrictions on the sale, printing, distribution, and storage of COTS technical data. The below paragraphs explain the
unique requirements for review and approval of COTS data.
3.18.1 COTS Manuals and Other Commercial/Contractor Data. COTS Manuals are acquired using the USAF TMCR
(TM 86-01) for centrally procured and managed (NSN’s assigned) equipment, no matter the format, and will be evaluated
for effectiveness and content IAW MIL-PRF-32216, Evaluation of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Manuals and Prepa-
ration of Supplemental Data. If acceptable, or if they can be supplemented to be acceptable, they will be adopted as TOs
(given a TO number) and indexed in ETIMS. This will NOT include COTS manuals for locally purchased equipment. Local
purchase manuals and software must be controlled and managed by the procurement activity.
3.18.2 COTS versus New Development. Existing commercial operating instructions, parts breakdown handbooks, and
repair manuals will be acquired instead of developing new TOs if no degradation in system operation, safety, support or
reliability will result IAW AFI 63-101/20-101. Using existing data will save money and time for the TO program. COTS
manuals will be reviewed and evaluated by the TOMA, MAJCOM and assigned Equipment Specialist (ES) IAW MIL-PRF-
32216.
3.18.2.1 Commercial aircraft maintenance and operations (ﬂight) manuals (FMP) proposed for use by Air Force personnel
must be reviewed by the TCM and FMM compared against both MIL-PRF-32216 and MIL-DTL-7700, Flight Manual,
Performance Data Appendix, Mission Crew Manual, Supplemental Manual, and Abbreviated Flight Crew Checklist and
other requirements. Air Force and commercial roles and responsibilities for ﬂight crews and ground crews are different.
3-38

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_70
TO 00-5-3
Reviewers must consider the possibility that commercial manuals may allocate maintenance and operations tasks differently
than military manuals, and if there are differences, take action to include changes in both the appropriate ﬂight crew and
maintenance manuals. Failure to consider this possibility could result in aircraft accidents or incidents.
3.18.2.2 Approved manuals will be adopted for Air Force use, assigned a TO number and managed in the TO system
unless a waiver is approved. Approved manuals will be developed to identify pertinent information associated with COTS
Manuals. An Identifying Technical Publication Sheet (ITPS) shall be posted as a cover page immediately on top of the
COTS manual title page or safety summary and shall provide all necessary information about the manual to include
deﬁnition of the AF limits of releasability and/or data rights. The ITPS shall list the appropriate distribution statement, export
control and destruction statements, and the authority notice IAW MIL-PRF-32216 (See Figure 3-3). Manuals which are
initially disapproved will be supplemented, if possible, to make them acceptable. With the exception of safety summaries,
ITPS supplemental data is numbered as routine formal supplements and ﬁled behind the COTS manual IAW TO 00-5-1.
Safety summaries should be posted directly behind the ITPS cover page, in front of the COTS manual. When supplementing
is not adequate, new TOs will be developed to military TMSS or approved commercial speciﬁcations. Careful consideration
of future support costs, incorporation of commercial updates, and ease of use will determine whether military or commercial
speciﬁcations should be used.
3.18.2.3 When military systems or end items use mixed maintenance support (organic and CLS), any COTS manuals and
manuals developed from contractor data may be accepted and then evaluated for adoption as technical orders per Paragraph
3.18.2.1. The decision to number, manage, and use commercial manuals in or outside the TO system will be made jointly by
the TOMA, user and appropriate TCM. Manuals used for organic (Air Force) operations or maintenance will be included in
the TO System unless a waiver is approved by HQ AFMC/A4F. When different user organizations have different operation
or maintenance support concepts, manuals will be managed in the TO System unless a waiver is approved by HQ AFMC/
A4F.
3.18.2.4 PMs must ensure, through the TOMA, that all contracts issued for procurement or sustainment of commercial or
militarized commercial systems and commodities require delivery of applicable FAA, manufacturer or vendor technical data
updates (service bulletins, operations manual bulletins, FAA airworthiness directives, temporary revisions, etc.). Use a DID
(when available), or ensure the CDRL for TO delivery requires delivery of these updating publications.
3.18.2.5 The TCM, TOMA, depot engineering or technical support activity and/or FMM will determine if any updates
received apply to TO-numbered ﬂight and/or maintenance manuals, and if the updates will be referenced by the commercial
number or will have the information extracted for inclusion in supplements or other TO updates. When a COTS TO user
becomes aware of a later version of the COTS manual that applies to their equipment (and not just to a later model/version
of the equipment), they should notify the ES/TCM so that he/she can evaluate the later manual version for adoption by the
Air Force. If adopted, the TO will be indexed in ETIMS.
3.18.2.6 For programs using temporary or Interim Contractor Support (ICS) contracts (support required until organic
capability is attained), data used by the contractor to fulﬁll the terms of the contract is excluded from numbering and
management in the TO System. However, if this data will transition to the Air Force, it is subject to review and veriﬁcation
by Air Force personnel. COTS and contractor manuals transferring to the Air Force will comply with this TO and MIL-PRF-
32216. Data developed for system or equipment contractor internal use, if later purchased by the government, will be treated
the same as COTS data.
3.18.2.7 When operation and/or maintenance are planned to be Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), whether the military
system or end item is commercially available or is developed speciﬁcally for the Air Force, the PM or SCM acquires,
numbers, and manages the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) data outside the TO system (no TO numbers are assigned).
However:
3.18.2.7.1 The data is subject to Air Force technical content, reproducibility and rights reviews to ensure it is adequate for
competition of follow-on contractor support (’Adequate’ means usable by another contractor with comparable skills and
experience to fulﬁll the terms of the contract).
3.18.2.7.2 Data developed or modiﬁed speciﬁcally for the CLS contract shall be certiﬁed by the contractor; Air Force
veriﬁcation is not required.
3.18.2.7.3 Pre-existing, unmodiﬁed commercial data shall be certiﬁed for adequacy and accuracy by the contractor ac-
quiring the data for the CLS contract.
3-39

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_71
TO 00-5-3
3.18.2.7.4 When existing military systems or end items are transitioned from organic support to CLS, TOs which will
continue to be used primarily by Air Force personnel will remain in the TO system. TOs which are peculiar to the system or
end item to be used totally (or with Air Force assistance) by the contractor, will normally be rescinded from the TO system
and managed as directed by the CLS contract. However, CLS contracts will require the contractor to use and maintain any
MIL-SPEC manuals in the MIL-SPEC format.
3.18.2.7.5 When CLS programs are transitioned to organic support, the policy in this TO will be used to evaluate,
approve, number and manage CLS manuals.
3.18.2.8 Factory Test Equipment (FTE) and Special Test Equipment (STE) and its support data are designed by a con-
tractor for internal use and are not commercially available. However, if the government decides to acquire the FTE and/or
STE for organic use, the policy in this TO will be used to accept the support data and to determine if it is included in or
excluded from the TO system.
3.18.3 Exclusions.
3.18.3.1 Per TO 00-5-1, the TO system includes all TOs developed or acquired for organic operation, maintenance,
inspection, modiﬁcation, or management of centrally acquired and managed Air Force systems and end items. The TO
system excludes:
3.18.3.1.1 Data used in programs or program segments (such as depot or intermediate-level maintenance) operated solely
(or with Air Force assistance) by CLS personnel are exempt from management within the TO system.
3.18.3.1.2 Manuals to support local purchase items (NOT centrally-procured, stock-numbered COTS equipment) are also
exempt (TO 00-5-1). The activity purchasing the item is responsible for acquiring, accepting, maintaining, controlling and
distributing these publications.

SECTION VI TECHNICAL ORDER SECURITY AND TECHNICAL DATA
RIGHTS
3.19 TECHNICAL ORDER SECURITY REQUIREMENTS.
3.19.1 General. TOs can contain classiﬁed data up to and including Secret Restricted Data. The following procedures
apply to classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed TOs containing data whose distribution must be controlled. TOMAs and TCMs/FMMs
will:
3.19.1.1 Verify TO data classiﬁcation using the applicable Security Classiﬁcation Guide (SCG). For contractors, the
applicable SCG may be listed in the DD Form 254,Contract Security Classiﬁcation Speciﬁcation, Department of Defense.
Ensure the TO title page and each page and paragraph in a classiﬁed TO is marked IAW DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1 and AFI
16-1404.
3.19.1.2 Issue classiﬁed technical data in supplemental TOs to the maximum extent possible to keep the majority of TOs
unclassiﬁed (TO 00-5-1). TO titles will be unclassiﬁed to the maximum extent possible.
3.19.1.3 Use the applicable SCG as authority to classify TO data needing security protection. Review contractor-prepared
classiﬁed Preliminary Technical Orders (PTOs) to ensure they have the proper security markings annotated IAW DoDM
5200.01, Vol 1 and AFI 16-1404. Advise the contractor of any required revisions to the PTOs or DD Form 254.
3.19.1.4 Review classiﬁed technical data during every TO update action or at least annually for possible classiﬁcation
downgrading according to the applicable SCG or DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1. TCMs must ensure their TOs are reviewed in a
timely manner. The task schedule should be set for less than one year to allow time to complete the review within the
required one-year period. Initial data for overdue currency review tracking may be obtained from HQ AFMC/A4F.
3.19.1.5 TO classiﬁcation changes are disseminated via a TO change or revision and listed in the Search New, Updated
and Inactive TOs function of the AF TO Catalog.
3.19.1.6 Issue unclassiﬁed updates to Classiﬁed TOs whenever possible.
3.19.1.7 Do not use the Not for Foreign Release (NOFORN) marking on TOs. In accordance with DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1,
Information Security Program, this code is only authorized for U.S. intelligence information.
3.19.1.8 Unclassiﬁed Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI) is a special category of information. To be considered for
protection as DoD UCNI, the information must be unclassiﬁed, pertain to security measures, including plans, procedures,
and equipment, for the physical protection of DoD Special Nuclear Material (SNM), equipment, or facilities, meet the
adverse effects test; i.e., that the unauthorized dissemination of such information could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by increasing signiﬁcantly the
likelihood of the illegal production of nuclear weapons or the theft, diversion, or sabotage of DoD SNM, equipment, or
facilities. (Ref DoDD 5210.83).
3.19.2 Classiﬁcation Upgrades. HQ AFMC must concur in the interpretation of the cited classiﬁcation authority for
upgrading the classiﬁcation of an already-distributed TO (if the TO was too widely distributed, reclassiﬁcation may not be
possible.) Notify HQ AFMC/A4F and the local Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) (Security Forces) of the
circumstances requiring an upgrade by classiﬁed message. Include the new level of security classiﬁcation, the classiﬁcation
authority, the number of copies issued, the length of time the information has existed at a lower classiﬁcation and if the
information is available from unclassiﬁed sources.
3.19.2.1 A4F shall consult with HQ AFMC to determine whether the security classiﬁcation action is Original Classiﬁca-
tion Authority directed. If so, a classiﬁed message furnishes authority to begin the upgrade action.
3.19.2.2 The TCM prepares an Emergency Interim Operational Supplement (IOS) or RAC IAW Chapter 4, to upgrade the
affected TO, and notiﬁes the responsible TOMA to update the TO index entry.
3-43

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_75
TO 00-5-3
3.19.3 Classiﬁcation Downgrade/Declassiﬁcation. The TOMA will issue an update directing the appropriate down-
grade or declassiﬁcation actions IAW DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1/ AFI 16-1404. TOMA shall send updated metadata to TODPG,
Reference Chapter 5.
NOTE
Downgrade of a small amount of material that does not change the overall classiﬁcation of the TO should not be
the sole justiﬁcation for issuing a TO update. However, notiﬁcation of the downgrading action and the data
involved must be provided to users of the TO.
3.19.4 Scientiﬁc and Technical Information (STINFO) Distribution Limitations. Distribution Statements speciﬁed in
DoDI 5230.24, shall be used IAW AFI 61-201 to mark all TOs and other technical data to specify availability for secondary
distribution, release and disclosure without additional approval or authorization from the Controlling DoD Office (See DoDI
5230.24). (Primary distribution is made by the Controlling DoD Office.) A distribution statement marking is distinct from
and in addition to a security classiﬁcation marking assigned IAW DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1/ AFI 16-1404. Air Force personnel
who originate or are responsible for technical documents must follow guidance contained in AFI 61-201, summarized below:
NOTE
Do not confuse the distribution statements formerly used for standard, nontechnical publications (AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management) with those used for TOs and technical data AFI 61-201). The latest revision
to AFI 33-360 has replaced these distribution codes (F and L) with a releasability statement. However, the old
codes will continue to appear on older AF publications for some time. The code F meant Public Release for
standard publications, but no release without Controlling DoD Office permission for technical data. AFI 33-360
used Limited (L) Distribution.
3.19.4.1 Distribution Statements. Controlling DoD Offices (CDO) i.e., FMMs and TCMs, shall mark interim and formal
TOs, TCTOs, PTOs, TO updates, source data, and other technical data (see deﬁnitions) with appropriate distribution state-
ments before dissemination IAW DoDI 5230.24 and AFI 61-201. Include the word ’Statement’ in your title ’Distribution
Statement D’. Apply the single most appropriate distribution statement A, B, C, D, E, or F (for secondary distribution) IAW
DoDI 5230.24 enclosure 5. Apply the distribution code/letter designator and verbiage IAW DoDI 5230.24. You may use as
many reasons that apply to the code/letter and content of the technical data. Include the Date of Determination and the
Controlling DoD Office (PM’s organizational symbol and program name). Verbiage for distribution statements and reasons
may NOT be modiﬁed IAW DoDI 5230.24. In addition, for B, C, D, and E distribution statements, you may include
’Secondary’ and the following text that precedes the distribution statement: ’The (Controlling DoD Office) authorizes
secondary distribution, release, and dissemination to the extent permitted by this distribution statement without additional
approvals or authorizations.’ TOMAs shall ensure the distribution code and reasons are reﬂected in the index record for
individual TOs. New DoDI 5230.24 guidance states Distribution Statement F is to be used under rare and exceptional
circumstances and only when a speciﬁc authority exists or when need-to-know must be veriﬁed. See DoDI 5230.24 for
options, (i.e., Executive Orders, statues such as Atomic Energy Federal regulation, etc.)
NOTE
Subsequent dissemination of formerly Distribution
Statement X documents shall display Distribu-
tion Statement C, with export control as the rea-
son, and shall be marked as directed by DoDI
5230.24, unless changed by the controlling DoD
office.
3.19.4.1.1 Signiﬁcant Military Equipment (SME). For purposes of determining the appropriate distribution markings for
Air Force TOs, and other technical documents, controlling offices shall refer to the United States Munitions List (USML),
the Commerce Control List (CCL), and the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) IAW AFI 61-201. The USML
designates some technical data items as Signiﬁcant Military Equipment. Technical data supporting items with this designa-
tion contain information that justiﬁes higher levels of protection. This technical information shall be restricted solely to U.S.
DoD activities or U.S. DoD contractors who hold contracts to speciﬁcally support such military equipment or have a
legitimate business relationship with the DoD. The DoD has the sole responsibility for determining that a legitimate business
relationship exists since the only purpose is to provide access to information created by or under the control of the DoD.
Acceptable distribution statements are D, E or F. Lower levels of protection may be justiﬁed for technical data in the USML
3-44

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_76
TO 00-5-3
that is not designated SME. Acceptable distribution statements are B or C. Higher levels of protection may be applicable
based on the speciﬁc content of the documents. Technical data not speciﬁcally related to items on the USML, CCL, or
MCTL will be assigned a distribution statement justiﬁed by the content of the document.
3.19.4.1.2 Distribution Statement A (Public Release). TOs for public release must be reviewed and assigned a case
number by the local Public Affairs (PA) office prior to release. (AFI 35-102, Air Force Security and Policy Review
Process). Ensure other required title page statements and warnings are applied IAW AFI 16-201,
International Affairs and
Security Assistance Management, and MIL-STD-38784, Manuals, Technical: General Style and Format Requirements. Add
the following statement immediately below the distribution statement wording: Public Affairs (PA) Case (or Certiﬁcate)
Number. Submit recommended changes (or problems) with this TO to the TOMAs office listed in the AF TO Catalog. The
exact wording is not critical.
3.19.4.1.3 Proprietary Data. If the distribution statement reason is Proprietary Data (distribution statements B and E
only) add a TO title page statement of government rights to disseminate, use, copy, etc., the data. When creating a technical
document containing company proprietary data, in addition to the distribution statement on the title page, the data owner
shall mark each page that contains proprietary information with the word proprietary and the name of the company (e.g.
Boeing Proprietary).
3.19.4.1.4 Supplements and Derived Data. Publish supplements using the distribution statement applicable to supple-
ment contents, not necessarily the parent TOs distribution statement. If derived documents are generated from the parent
technical data, apply the parent document distribution control markings to the derived documents, unless the purpose was to
publish unrestricted data in an unrestricted document.
3.19.4.1.5 COTS Manuals. Distribution Statements must be assigned to COTS manuals when they are adopted as TOs.
In cases where the Air Force has unlimited rights, this may be Distribution A, because these manuals are publicly available
(a PA release certiﬁcate is still required). In some cases, the vendor may have copyrighted the manuals, and if the Air Force
does not have a copyright release (usually marked on the title page), the distribution statement should be C or D. In rare
cases, non-commercial contractor manuals may contain proprietary data in order to be considered proprietary; they must be
marked by the vendor/contractor as shown in Paragraph 3.19.4.1.3, and will carry distribution statements B or E. Distribu-
tion statements and other title page notices and warnings listed below shall be placed on an Identifying Technical Publication
Sheet (ITPS) cover page, ﬁled in front of the COTS manual title page.
3.19.4.2 Export Control Statement. Mark documents that contain export-controlled technical data IAW the Arms Export
Control Act or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, with one of the following export control statements. Use
the abbreviated statement only on documents without sufficient title page/label space to include the full statement, e.g.
CD-ROM/DVD labels, reduced size TOs, etc.:
WARNING – This document contains technical data whose export is
restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. 2751,
et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended
Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401, et seq. Violations of these export-con-
trol laws is subject to severe criminal penalties. Dissemination of
this document is controlled under DoDD 5230.25.
OR
WARNING– Export Controlled.
3.19.4.3 Disclosure Notice. If a disclosure notice is required (reference MIL-STD-38784), apply the disclosure notice to
all classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed TOs approved for release to a foreign government, except those assigned Distribution State-
ment A. The disclosure notice shall be on all classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed nuclear TOs. On CD/ROMs/DVDs, the Disclosure
Notice will go in the content.txt ﬁle, as well as on the opening screen of each TO on the disk.
3.19.4.4 Disposition and Destruction Notices. Assign a Disposition Notice (for public release documents) or Handling
and Destruction notice (for all other technical documents) IAW MIL-STD-38784. See TO 00-5-1 for speciﬁc disposition/
destruction procedures for unclassiﬁed paper TOs and digital media.
3.19.4.5 Dissemination Notice. Notice to Accompany the Dissemination of Export-Controlled Technical Data. A copy of
the Notice (DoDD 5230.25 Enclosure 5) must accompany every shipment of Export Controlled TOs. The Notice must be
included with all E* accounts and U.S./Canadian DoD contractors. Do NOT include the Notice with F* accounts. The
Notice must be included with all types of media, paper, digital, electronic, etc. Digital ﬁles (.pdf,.tiff,.jpeg,.wav,.avi,, etc.)
3-45

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_77
TO 00-5-3
Distribution via digital storage media (CDs, DVDs, etc.), must include a digital read-me-ﬁle of the Notice. Electronic/WA
ﬁles housed in ETIMS or other electronic repository must include a digital copy of the Notice (.pdf) attached to beginning of
the digital TO ﬁle or as an additional digital ﬁle. Distribution via electronic/digital means (emails, etc.), must be encrypted
through all email transmissions and must include a digital (.pdf) copy of the Notice.
3.19.4.6 If necessary, the TCM shall request assistance with determining STINFO markings from the local STINFO
Officer. For additional training on the STINFO program, see the courses at https://af-aqweb.deps.mil/pages/default.aspx or
contact your local STINFO Officer.
3.19.5 Digital TO Security. Security issues and procedures are covered in DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1, AFI 16-1404, AFI
17–100, Air Force Information Technology (IT) Service Management, AFI 17–130, Cybersecurity Program Management, Air
Force Systems Security Instruction (AFSSI) 8520, Identiﬁcation and Authentication, and AFI 61-201 among others. User
access to and distribution methods for digital TO ﬁles must provide adequate security for classiﬁed and limited-distribution
TO data ﬁles (Paragraph 5.5). Classiﬁed TO ﬁles must be encrypted using a National Security Agency (NSA)-approved
encryption algorithm, while limited-distribution ﬁles require a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-
approved encryption system prior to being hosted on servers. Except for distribution statement A documents, TO ﬁles must
be encrypted and hosted on a secure Internet https server with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certiﬁcate or user name and
password access control.
3.19.5.1 Encryption. NIST has approved use of strong encryption technology (128-bit capable/export controlled) pro-
vided by the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol for use with unclassiﬁed, limited distribution technical data. Each organi-
zation planning to provide access to TO/TO updates via the Internet must establish a secure server with the SSL protocol
installed. Access to the server must be controlled by the use of PKI certiﬁcates or user names and passwords. In some cases,
domain restrictions (.mil, .gov) might be used for DoD and/or government agency access, combined with user name and
password access for authorized contractors. Additional information and assistance should be obtained from the local Com-
munications (Comm) Squadron.
3.19.5.2 Password Protection.
Exercise extreme care when manipulating digital TO ﬁles as technical content must not be altered unless autho-
rized in writing by the CE (Paragraph 2.1.3).
All secure servers must be protected by PKI certiﬁcates or user name/password access controls. The System Administrator
(SA) is responsible for assigning user names and passwords for protection of a secure server. When necessary, the user name
and password will be provided in a secure email message to TODOs requiring access to RACs and new baseline TO ﬁles.
The SA is also responsible for periodically changing passwords to help prevent unauthorized access and protect the infor-
mation on the site. TOMAs who previously chose to password protect digital TO ﬁles may be required to provide the
password to select subscribers using an authorized, secure method. This will enable subscribers to manipulate digital TO
ﬁles in support of their unique requirements, such as custom printing.
3.19.6 Controlling Distribution of Technical Orders. TOMAs must control the distribution of TOs to eligible recipients
IAW DoDM 5200.01, Vol 1/ AFI 16-1404, AFI 61-201, and for reasons speciﬁed in this TO. For Air Force TO System
implementation of the STINFO Process, TO Distribution Offices (TODOs) complete the primary distribution process on
behalf of the Controlling DoD Offices (CDO), to any accounts and may make primary distribution to any accounts and
sub-accounts based on mission requirements. If proprietary TOs must be distributed to Government-Owned, Contractor-
Operated (GOCO) Accounts, the contractor personnel must have signed non-disclosure agreements on ﬁle with their com-
pany.
3.19.6.1 Export Controlled TOs. The TOMA, in conjunction with the TCM, will determine if any TOs containing export
controlled data (DoDI 5230.24 and AFI 61-201) require sponsor approval to satisfy the distribution control requirements
of AFI 61-201. In general, export controlled TOs may be released to all F*xxxx and E*xxxx accounts. FMS (D*xxxx)
accounts must request TOs through the Security Assistance Technical Order Data System (SATODS) and have Foreign
Disclosure Office (FDO) (IAW AFI 16-201) approval prior to release for initial subscription or requisition. AFMC Centers
will document local procedures for controlling the distribution of export controlled data in a supplement to this TO.
Exception: Nuclear Weapons TOs are managed at the AF Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) and are not to be placed in
SATODS.
3-46

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_78
TO 00-5-3
3.19.6.2 Proprietary and Copyrighted Data. When a program acquires copyrighted data, the Air Force must receive at
least limited rights allowing reproduction and distribution of the data for government purposes, IAW Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) clauses. Unlimited rights are recommended whenever possible. Proprietary
data must be marked IAW Paragraph 3.19.4.1.3, and distribution limited to government personnel, unless speciﬁcally re-
leased by the owner of the data.
3.19.6.3 Linking to Other TOs or Web Sites. When a TO references other TOs or documents, hot links may only be
used when the referenced TO or other data is of the same or lower restriction/classiﬁcation. References may be made to
other TOs or other data which have a higher restriction/classiﬁcation, but not linked. The same rule applies to unclassiﬁed/
unrestricted Internet sites: these can only hot link to other unclassiﬁed/unrestricted sites, although it can list the URLs of
restricted sites.
3.19.7 Electronic Distribution. The methods speciﬁed in Paragraph 5.5 shall be used for secure electronic distribution of
digital Controlled Unclassiﬁed Information (CUI). CUI includes technical data and TOs, engineering data, and other infor-
mation listed in DoDI 5230.24 and AFI 61-201, and assigned distribution codes B through F.
3.19.8 Release of Restricted TOs and Data. TOMAs and FMMs are responsible for distributing TOs to authorized
users. In some cases, this could include determining (in conjunction with the TCM) whether to release or withhold TOs
requested by individuals or companies through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process. FOIA requests for TOs
marked D, E or F for Administrative or Operational Use, Proprietary Data or Direct Military Support shall be refused using
Exemption Number 3 (DoDM 5400.07, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program). For determining whether it is appro-
priate to release a TO, it is USAF interpretation of DoD policy that Air Force Technical Orders are solely intended for direct
support of military and weapon systems. As such, release shall only be authorized to U.S. DoD contractors as deﬁned in
DoDI 3200.14, DoD Scientiﬁc and Technical Information (STI) Program (STIP), and DoDI 5230.24, Distribution State-
ments on Technical Documents. Other requests for Air Force TOs shall be referred to the Controlling DoD Office (CDO,
generally the TCM or FMM). Example: although the CDO may make exceptions, others cannot; and may share Distribution
Statement D TOs only with DoD units or with DoD contractors with active contracts for the weapon system covered by the
TOs in question. The FMM is the responsible release authority for Accident Investigation Boards (AIB) requests; with regard
to any possible public domain release of ﬂight manual data. Contractors responding to Requests for Proposal (RFP), when
qualiﬁed, may access relevant weapon system TOs in a Bidders Library or electronic ﬁle maintained by the RFP-issuing
program office or contracting office IAW TO 00-5-1.
3.20 RIGHTS IN TECHNICAL DATA.
3.20.1 Deﬁnitions.
3.20.1.1 Technical Data. Recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording, of a scientiﬁc or
technical nature (including computer software documentation).
3.20.1.2 Non-Technical Data. 1) Data describing the contractor itself, or information incident to performance of contract
(corporate information such as G&A, overheads, salaries, etc.) 2) Oral communications or information never recorded. 3)
Physical manifestations of technical data, such as the very product whose design is described in the data (i.e., hardware).
3.20.2 Rights in Technical Data - Non-Commercial Items (DFARS 252.227.7013). TOs, commercial manuals, and
contractor data may be copyrighted and/or contain proprietary data. TOs and non-commercial contractor data are procured
with Unlimited Rights, Government Purpose Rights, or Limited Rights (see below) using Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clauses at 252.227-7013. Commercial manuals are procured with the same types of rights
using DFARS clauses at 252.227-7015. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, if the manuals were prepared for or
acquired by the government pursuant to the contract, the contractor should grant the government a license allowing repro-
duction, distribution, use and development of derivative works, or to have others do so for the government. (Derivative
works are publications such as checklists and workcards developed from one or more basic manuals.) The distribution of the
manuals outside the government shall be done strictly IAW the contract and applicable regulations (DFARS part 227.7103-5,
etc.). For example, when the government has only limited rights in the data, the license is limited by the deﬁnition of limited
rights in the DFARS. In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the government’s needs or the government
may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for other consideration. However, the licensor is not obligated to
provide the government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights
provided in the standard grant of license.
3-47

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_79
TO 00-5-3
3.20.2.1 License Rights. The government obtains rights in technical data, including a copyright license, under an irre-
vocable license granted or obtained for the government by the contractor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the
data not granted to the government. For technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the
license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When the technical
data do not pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used to
create the data.
3.20.2.2 Unlimited Rights. Unlimited rights means rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose
technical data in whole or in part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do so
(DFARS 252.227-7013(a)(15)). Unless other rights as described in Paragraph 3.20.2.3 or Paragraph 3.20.2.4 have been
agreed to in writing IAW DFARS 227.7103-5, the government shall have a non-exclusive, irrevocable, and worldwide
unlimited right to technical data purchased under the terms of the contract. The government may use the work within the
government without restriction, and may release or disclose the work outside the government and authorize persons to whom
release or disclosure has been made to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the work on behalf of
the government. The government’s license includes the right to distribute copies of the work to the public for government
purposes.
3.20.2.3 Government Purpose Rights. Government purpose means any activity in which the United States Government
is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or transfers
by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations. Government purposes include
competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose
technical data for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so (DFARS 252.227-7013(a)(11)). Government purpose
rights means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display or disclose technical data within the government
without restriction; and release or disclose technical data outside the government and authorize persons to whom release or
disclosure has been made to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform display, or disclose that data for U.S. government
purposes (DFARS 252.227-7013(a) (12)).
3.20.2.4 Limited Rights (DFARS 252.227-7013)(a)(13). Limited rights permit the government to use, modify, repro-
duce, release, perform, display or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the government. The government may
not, without the permission of the party asserting the limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the
government; use the technical data for manufacture; or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except:
3.20.2.4.1 The government may reproduce, release or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data
by persons outside the government if reproduction, release, disclosure or use is necessary for emergency repair or overhaul;
or
3.20.2.4.2 A release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such
data by, a foreign government that is in the interest of the (U.S.) government and is required for evaluation or informational
purposes;
3.20.2.4.3 Subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure or use; and
3.20.2.4.4 The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notiﬁed of such reproduction, release, disclosure or
use.
3.20.2.5 Copyrights. Rights clauses cover the release of data. Copyrights govern the reproduction and modiﬁcation of
data. According to DFARS clause 252.227-7013(f), any commercial or non-commercial publication TO which carries a
copyright shall also contain a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402. This notice shall be placed
thereon by the contractor prior to delivery. If no copyright notice is placed on the work, the government obtains unlimited
rights in the work. Otherwise, when claim to copyright is made the Contractor grants the government, and others acting on
its behalf, a license to the work.
3.20.2.6 Proprietary Rights. Proprietary information is conﬁdential information that constitutes a trade secret and/or
information that is commercial or ﬁnancial and conﬁdential and privileged. Proprietary data is submitted to the government
under a contract and is subject to protection by the contractor and the government. According to AFI 61-201 , when creating
a technical document containing company proprietary data, in addition to distribution statement (B or E), mark each page
that contains proprietary information with the word proprietary and the name of the company.

3.20.2.7 Digitization of Limited Rights Data. Documents, including commercial manuals, which are authorized for
government reproduction, may be digitized for reproduction and/or distribution without affecting the authorization. Any
supplemental data required to make the manual acceptable for use as a TO may be merged with the basic manual during the
digitization process, unless speciﬁcally prohibited in a limited rights agreement.
3.20.3 Contracting for Greater Data Rights. If the government needs technical data pertaining to items developed at
private expense to establish alternative sources it may, under certain circumstances, acquire greater rights in data. DFARS
Subpart 227.7103-5, which sets forth the procedures to acquire greater rights, requires the acquisition of greater rights be
stated as a separate CLIN.
3.20.4 Rights in Technical Data - Commercial Items (DFARS 252.227.7015). This DFARS clause provides the
government speciﬁc license rights in technical data pertaining to commercial items or processes. DoD may use, modify,
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose data only within the government. The data may not be used to manufacture
additional quantities of the commercial items and, except for emergency repair or overhaul, may not be released or disclosed
to, or used by, third parties without the contractor’s written permission.
SECTION VII SOURCE DATA
3.21 GENERAL.
Source data, as used in this TO, is information of any sort used to develop or update TOs. The contractor uses source data
from program development and test for program TOs. The TOMA must acquire any source data required to develop or
update non-program TOs (e.g., weapon data to update aircraft loading TOs) or to assist associated contractors with TO
development or update (e.g., a support equipment vendor). The TOMA must follow up on source data delivery to ensure that
TOs to be developed or updated will be published in time to meet program milestones.
NOTE
Source data developed organically by the Air Force does not require certiﬁcation, but must be veriﬁed prior to
delivery or incorporation into a TO.
3.21.1 Types of TOs Requiring Source Data. Types of TOs where source data would be required include, but are not
limited to, Aircraft Emergency Rescue, EOD/RSP, Munitions Loading, Munitions Positioning and Tiedown, Weapons De-
livery, and Explosive Storage and Maintenance manuals. Source data on support equipment provided by other contractors is
required for prime contractor developed TOs.
3.21.2 Procedural Source Data. Procedural data is a special category of source data required during most TO develop-
ment and acquisition programs. This data is a similar and organized grouping of the data required to perform operations and
maintenance tasks on a military system or commodity item. The data is acquired when development of a stand-alone TO is
inappropriate, or when TOs managed by other agencies must be updated. The content of procedural data is determined by the
appropriate contract requirements, and includes text, diagrams, illustrations, charts, schematics and other data required to
describe the procedures and support equipment.
3.21.3 Source Data OPRs. OPRs requiring source data must be included in program TO Planning/Requirements Con-
ferences (Paragraph 3.4.1) to ensure data requirements are speciﬁed accurately in RFPs and contracts. OPRs munitions-
unique OPRs and requirements are covered in this chapter.
3.21.4 Delivery. The contractor provides certiﬁed, adequate, safe and accurate source data as required by the contract. The
TOMA must work with the source data recipient to ensure that data provided is adequate. Delivery requirements may differ
between OPRs and users as well. In some cases a single delivery may be sufficient, while other cases require deliveries or
updates throughout the period of the contract.
3.22 ACQUISITION OF SOURCE DATA.
3.22.1 Development. Many different MIL-SPECs and DIDs may be used to procure source and procedural data, includ-
ing those for Standard Data Packages (SDPs), engineering drawings, test and inspection reports, interface control documen-
tation, and supportability analysis tasks. EOD source data is acquired using DI-SAFT-80931, Explosive Ordnance Disposal
Data. Aircraft Emergency Rescue Information (Fire Protection) source data is acquired using DI-TMSS-81532, Aerospace
3-49

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_81
TO 00-5-3
Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information (Emergency Services) Source Data. Existing contractor data may be
acquired through the contract Data Accession List. If existing TOs managed by the TOMA or temporarily placed under
TOMA control require updating, Table 2 of the TMCR, TM 86-01 may be used to obtain updates, supplements or source
data.
3.22.2 Acquisition Procedures. Procedures for source data acquisition are the same as for TOs. Source data requirements
are determined during the TO Guidance Conference. In-Process Reviews are held as required. The contractor applies internal
certiﬁcation management processes and delivers an adequate, accurate data package for Air Force veriﬁcation. After veriﬁ-
cation is complete, the contractor makes corrections as required; the package receives a ﬁnal review if necessary and is
delivered to the appropriate agency.
3.23 NONNUCLEAR WEAPONS DELIVERY SOURCE DATA - WEAPONS SOURCE DATA PACKAGE (AIR-
CRAFT -34 SERIES TECHNICAL ORDERS AND TO 1-1M-34).
The Weapons Source Data Package (WSDP) provides aircrew weapons delivery information for newly developed or modi-
ﬁed nonnuclear munitions.
3.23.1 Requirements. The WSDP is developed to support four main requirements: (1) AFMC Development Test and
Evaluation (DT&E); (2) Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E); (3) revisions to both aircraft-speciﬁc weapons
delivery manuals (-34 series) and the TO 1-1M-34 series Standard Volumes; and (4) user-unique Flight and/or Weapons
Delivery Planning Programs. (Planning Programs provide the user with automated ballistic solutions for mission planning.)
NOTE
For weapon systems with authorized release to FMS countries, a separate WSDP is developed for each country
with approved FDO release IAW AFI 16-201.
3.23.2 Contents. WSDP data consists of a section for generic munitions data and sections of aircraft-speciﬁc data for
each aircraft which will employ the munitions item. WSDP content is described in MIL-DTL-38384, Manuals, Technical –
Aircraft Nonnuclear / Nuclear Weapon Delivery Procedures.
3.23.3 Development. Delivery envelopes for unguided and laser guided GBU-10/12/16/27/28/54 series munitions are
normally developed by the Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO), 46 SK/SKA, from computer simulation programs.
Envelopes for precision guided munitions (six degree of freedom or 6DOF weapons) are normally provided by the weapon
contractor as a part of the WSDP.
3.23.4 Procedures and Responsibilities.
3.23.4.1 WSDP acquisition participants are the munitions TOMA, MAJCOM(s), aircraft PMs, AFLCMC/LZSA-Eglin (for
TO 1-1M-34), the Responsible Test Organization (RTO) and AFSEO.
3.23.4.2 The contractor develops the WSDP to meet established program schedules; the package should be delivered at
least 30 calendar days prior to the start of DT&E. During IPRs, the WSDP is reviewed for use of common and standard
terms for munitions items. Contractor QA is limited to Desk-Top Analysis.
3.23.4.3 RTOs and AFSEO use the WSDP during aircraft/munitions testing to verify procedures. AFSEO initiates action,
if required, to incorporate the weapons data into the Combat Weapon Delivery Software (CWDS) mission planning program.
The testing agencies document any discrepancies and forward them to the munitions TOMA for action. An updated WSDP
must be available 30 days prior to the start of IOT&E.
3.23.4.4 MAJCOMs and support agencies use the WSDP during IOT&E and forward any additional discrepancies to the
munitions TOMA.
3.23.4.5 The munitions TOMA distributes the ﬁnal WSDP to the appropriate aircraft PMs, AFLCMC/LZSA-Eglin, 102
West D Ave, Suite 160, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5415, DSN 875-7990 (for TO 1-1M-34), and AFSEO, 46 SK/SKA, 205 West
D Ave, Suite 348, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6865, DSN 872-0450. The TOMA will also provide initial hardware delivery and
user need dates (SEEK EAGLE PMD 5077) for informational and work effort planning purposes.
3-50

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_82
TO 00-5-3
3.23.4.6 AFSEO issues the Certiﬁcation Recommendation (CR) upon completion of SEEK EAGLE testing. The CR is
required by the aircraft PMs prior to formalization of the weapons delivery TOs.
3.23.4.7 The aircraft PMs update each applicable aircraft weapons delivery TO, make formal distribution, and issue the
Certiﬁcation Completion Notiﬁcation.
3.23.4.8 AFSEO develops and maintains CWDS through a Mission Planning Enterprise Contract (MPEC) at Hanscom
AFB, MA. At the completion of Functional Qualiﬁcation Test (FQT) by the developer, a copy of the CWDS is sent to 84
SCSG/GBSVM either by AFSEO (Joint Mission Planning System versions) or the developer (Portable Flight Planning
Software versions) for distribution to the Developmental Test/Operational Test (DT/OT) organizations. When OT certiﬁes
the CWDS version, 84 SCSG/GBSVM makes formal distribution to the ﬁeld. Weapon source data packages are used to
correctly add new weapons to CWDS.
3.23.4.9 AFLCMC/LZSA-Eglin completes the update of TO 1-1M-34.
3.24 NONNUCLEAR MUNITIONS AND AIRCRAFT LOADING SOURCE DATA - STANDARD DATA PACKAGE
(AIRCRAFT -33 SERIES TECHNICAL ORDERS AND TO 1-1M-33).
3.24.1 Requirements. A Standard or Source Data Package (SDP) containing nonnuclear munitions loading source data is
required during the development and testing of new munitions items or systems, for integration of existing munitions with
new aircraft, for integration of new munitions with new aircraft, and for major modiﬁcations to existing aircraft/munitions
conﬁgurations.
3.24.2 Contents. SDP contents are speciﬁed in MIL-DTL-9977. Manuals, Technical - Nonnuclear Munitions and Nuclear
Weapons Basic Information, Loading Procedures Manuals, and Standard Data Packages and Loading Procedures, NATO
Stage B Cross-Servicing, Functional Check Procedures, and End of Runway Procedures Checklists,. The SDP contains
munitions descriptive data, munitions preparation data, and loading procedures, but NO aircraft-speciﬁc procedures or data.
The SDP must be veriﬁed and approved before use.
3.24.3 Development. The SDP is maintained by the munitions acquisition TOMA.
3.24.4 Nonnuclear Munitions Loading TOs. The -33 series TOs and checklists contain descriptive data and procedures
for loading nonnuclear munitions on or into Air Force aircraft. TO 1-1M-33 contains descriptive data for munitions, suspen-
sion equipment, guns and gun pods, support equipment, and supplementary information.
3.24.5 Participants. SDP acquisition participants include the TOMA, MAJCOM(s), aircraft PMs, AFLCMC/EBHMA (for
the SDP), AFLCMC/LZSA-Eglin (for TO 1-1M-33), the RTO and AFSEO.
3.24.6 Procedures for New Munitions. The following steps outline the sequence of events for incorporation of new
munitions items on new or existing aircraft. Paragraph 3.24.7 provides abbreviated procedures for incorporating existing
munitions into additional military systems.
3.24.6.1 The contractor develops the SDP to meet established program schedules; delivery should be at least 30 calendar
days prior to the start of DT&E. During IPRs, the SDP is reviewed for use of common and standard terms for munitions
items. Contractor certiﬁcation is limited to Desk-Top Analysis.
3.24.6.2 AFSEO or equivalent reviews and coordinates the Source Data for RTO use during DT&E.
3.24.6.3 The test activity or designated office prepares local guidance i.e. -33 checklist, munitions procedures etc., from
the source data. Non-procedural munitions technical documentation/data packages (identiﬁcation, inspection, storage and
handling to include an IHC for hazardous items) will be coordinated through the local RTO/DTO wing’s SES/SEW, QA and
Munitions Flight; approval level is the RTO/DTO wing’s SES/SEW office. All other checklists/procedures will comply with
MILSPEC format and veriﬁed for use IAW local RTO directives to support DT&E and SEEK EAGLE certiﬁcation. In
addition, procedures and checklists used by RTO require MXG/CC (or equivalent) approval.
3.24.6.4 After completion of DT&E and SEEK EAGLE testing, comments or corrections to the SDP are coordinated with
AFSEO and sent to the TOMA.
3-51

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_83
TO 00-5-3
3.24.6.5 The TOMA will initiate veriﬁcation scheduling in coordination with the munitions OT&E manager and the lead
MAJCOM. Veriﬁcation should be scheduled within 120 days after the estimated receipt of the revised SDP. The lead
MAJCOM will develop and publish a coordinated veriﬁcation schedule based on the availability of aircraft, personnel and
equipment required for veriﬁcation.
3.24.6.6 The AFSEO reviews and approves the revised SDP, and forwards the package through the TOMA to affected
agencies (including AFLCMC/LZSA-Eglin) at least 90 days prior to the scheduled start of veriﬁcation. The affected aircraft
PMs develop (or contract for development of) preliminary -33 loading procedures for each aircraft involved, and provide
them to the affected MAJCOMs, AFLCMC/EBHMA, and the OT&E manager at least 30 days prior to veriﬁcation.
3.24.6.7 Veriﬁcation participants will include representatives from each aircraft PM involved, affected MAJCOMs, the
OT&E manager, AFLCMC/EBHMA SDP Office, the munitions TOMA, and the AFSEO, if required. The lead MAJCOM
will provide the Veriﬁcation Team Manager (VTM) for multi-aircraft veriﬁcations, while the aircraft PM provides the VTM
for single aircraft veriﬁcations. The load crew is provided by the MAJCOM. Both the SDP and the preliminary -33
procedures are veriﬁed.
3.24.6.8 After completion of veriﬁcation, AFLCMC/EBHMA converts to an approved SDP. Required veriﬁcation changes
to the SDP are sent through the munitions TOMA to the contractor for update. Changes to preliminary -33 procedures are
routed to the aircraft TOMAs for similar update.
3.24.6.9 The veriﬁed SDP and preliminary -33 procedures, marked: For OT&E Use Only, are used for the duration of
OT&E. The test team continues to evaluate the SDP, and preliminary aircraft -33 procedures during OT&E and submits
comments and recommended corrections to the respective OPRs.
3.24.6.10 Proposed updates and corrections are approved by a TORB consisting of the TOMA(s), AFSEO, the MAJ-
COMs and AFLCMC/EBHMA. AFLCMC/EBHMA updates and distributes the approved SDP to aircraft PMs and AFLCMC/
LZSA-Eglin. The PM TOMAs will use the SDP and -33 procedures to develop formal aircraft -33 TOs. The munitions
TOMA will maintain the currency of the SDP.
3.24.6.11 Aircraft PMs are responsible for providing AFLCMC/EBHMA and AFLCMC/LZSA-Eglin with updated de-
scriptive data (including illustrations) for new or modiﬁed aircraft-peculiar test equipment, Munitions Material Handling
Equipment, special tools, etc., required for inclusion in TO 1-1M-33 and 11A-1-63, Munitions Assembly Procedures.
AFLCMC/EBH and AFLCMC/LZSA-Eglin will use the SDP and PM inputs to update the TOs.
3.24.6.12 AFSEO ﬂight certiﬁcation is dependent upon publication of formal -1,-33, and -34 TOs and update of TOs
11M-33, 1-1M-34 and 11A-1-63. This must be accomplished in time to meet the need date speciﬁed in the SEEK EAGLE
PMD.
3.24.7 Procedures for Existing Munitions. The following abbreviated steps are for incorporation of existing munitions
on additional or new aircraft.
3.24.7.1 The MAJCOM requests AFSEO certiﬁcation for additional aircraft which require certiﬁcation with an existing
munitions or stores item.
3.24.7.2 The aircraft TOMA (or munitions TOMA during munitions acquisition) will request the MAJCOM to coordinate
with the affected agencies and schedule veriﬁcation of the loading procedures.
3.24.7.3 The aircraft TOMA requests the applicable SDP(s) from AFLCMC/EBHMA SDP and develops (or contracts for
the development of) preliminary -33 loading procedures. The procedures must be available for review at least 30 days prior
to the start of veriﬁcation. Veriﬁcation and update of procedures are the same as for new munitions.
3.24.7.4 Upon completion of AFSEO testing and receipt of the CR, the aircraft PM will provide any changed or modiﬁed
data to AFLCMC/LZSA-Eglin for inclusion in TO 1-1M-33 and to AFLCMC/EBHMA for inclusion in TO 11A-1-63,
incorporate necessary changes into the aircraft -33 TO and issue the certiﬁcation completion notice.

TO 00-5-3
3.25 NONNUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL (EOD)/RENDER SAFE PROCEDURES (RSP)
SOURCE DATA.
EOD/RSP source data, developed IAW DID DI-SAFT-80931, provides information and procedures for the development
and/or update of joint service Category 60 TOs on newly developed or modiﬁed bombs and warheads; fuses and fusing
systems; guided and ballistic missiles, grenades, artillery, mortar, rocket, and small arms ammunition; mines and torpedoes;
depth charges, demolition charges, and pyrotechnics; clusters and dispensers; cartridge- and propellant-actuated devices
(such as aircraft egress systems); and all similar or related items or components which may cause injury to personnel or
damage to material. This includes ALL new or modiﬁed aircraft, munitions, delivery systems such as Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles and Unmanned Ground Vehicles and ordnance items that contain explosives, propellants, and/or hazardous chemi-
cals.
3.25.1 EOD TOs. Category 60 TOs (and source data) differ from maintenance TOs in that EOD TOs provide information
and guidance rather than detailed step-by-step procedures. These TOs are typically used in accident, incident, mishap,
dud-dropped and dud-ﬁred situations where the systems or items have been damaged or failed to function as designed and
standard TO maintenance procedures cannot be used.
3.25.2 Air Force Liaison. AFCEC/CXE is the Air Force centralized agency for EOD data acquisition and liaison with the
NSWC IHEODTD.
3.25.3 Requirements. The EOD source data package is developed to support three main requirements: (1) RTO need for
emergency EOD, RSP and (if required) recovery procedures during DT&E operations, product improvement testing, failure
analysis, and initial space vehicle deployment; (2) MAJCOM need for emergency EOD and RSP during OT&E operations;
and (3) Development of the Joint Service Category 60 TOs by NSWC IHEODTD.
3.25.4 Participants. The TOMA will invite EOD representatives from AFCEC/CXE, the RTO, and MAJCOMs to the TO
Planning/Requirements Conference. AFCEC/CXE will normally be delegated as the representative for other EOD activities.
At the conference, the representatives will identify and justify requirements for data for EOD operations, and commodities
and recovery equipment to support EOD TO certiﬁcation and veriﬁcation, and determine delivery schedules. EOD SDP is
developed IAW DID DI-SAFT-80931.
3.25.5 Delivery. Critical delivery dates are initial delivery for DT&E, delivery for OT&E, and delivery for TO develop-
ment. TO development may take up to 12 months, depending on availability of hardware for veriﬁcation. DoD requires
delivery of veriﬁed TOs 30 days prior to ﬁelding/stockpile (DoDD 5160.62 and AFI 32 -3001).
3.25.6 EOD SDP Procedures.
3.25.6.1 The contractor develops the SDP IAW DI-SAFT-80931. The package should be delivered at least 60 calendar
days prior to the scheduled delivery of assets for Air Force testing. During IPRs, the SDP is reviewed for conformance to
item and system conﬁguration and identiﬁcation of Hazardous Item Recovery Candidates required for recovery and test
failure analysis. AFCEC/CXE or a designated representative will participate in the Contractor certiﬁcation process.
3.25.6.2 The AFMC EOD RTO supporting system or commodity testing will integrate the SDP data into the Test Support
Project for the system or commodity and submit the project to a Safety/Hazard Review Board for approval before use.
During DT&E, the RTO will document any comments or discrepancies with the SDP on an AFTO Form 27, and forward the
form to the TOMA and AFCEC/CXE. If at any time the data is determined to be no longer safe for use (due to errors in the
data, modiﬁcations to the hardware, or other reasons), the RTO will stop testing, notify the TOMA of actions required to
resolve the problem(s), and obtain corrections prior to continuing testing. AFCEC/CXE and the MAJCOM EOD represen-
tative must review and approve the DT&E-revised SDP prior to further use.
3.25.6.3 Procedures for OT&E are the same as for DT&E, except that the EOD RTO is usually a MAJCOM agency and
must ensure the MAJCOM has approved the data for use. The OT&E-revised SDP is used to support development of the
joint service Category 60 TO. The TOMA will re-verify the user TO need date and ensure the AFCEC/CXE schedules have
incorporated the date.
NOTE
NSWC IHEODTD is a working capital fund organization and charges a fee based on EOD TO SOW complexity.
3-53

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_85
TO 00-5-3
3.25.6.4 Once the source data package is received by AFCEC/CXE, the SDP is forwarded to NSWC IHEODTD. NSWC
IHEODTD formulates a SOW and cost estimate to create or revise an EOD TO. NSWC IHEODTD provides a copy of the
SOW to the responsible program office for funding. Once the ﬁnal SDP (i.e., conﬁguration lock) and funding is received, the
TO should be completed in 180 days. AFCEC/CXE initiates the joint service development project with NSWC IHEODTD
and establishes a distribution need date, based on the Required Assets Available (RAA) and/or the Initial Operational
Capability (IOC) date of the weapon system. The NSWC IHEODTD in concert with the four service detachments will
develop, validate, verify and publish the TO for DoD EOD use. Distribution and publishing will be via the Joint EOD Portal
and JEOD MFK software. JEOD MFK software is distributed quarterly (Mar, Jun, Sep, and Dec). Some foreign customers
may receive EOD TOs in Adobe.PDF format when the NSWC IHEODTD International Programs Office (IPO) determines
them releasable.
3.25.6.5 The TOMA monitors the development process to ensure required support equipment is available, any hardware
conﬁguration changes are forwarded, and delivery schedules will be met. If veriﬁed TOs will not be available in time to meet
DoD and user requirements, the TOMA must work with AFCEC/CXE to develop interim support procedures.
SECTION VIII DIGITAL TECHNICAL ORDER AND TECHNICAL MANUALS
SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS (TMSS) REQUIREMENTS
3.26 DIGITAL TECHNICAL ORDER DATA.
3.26.1 Policy. All major TO modiﬁcation programs must perform a Cost Beneﬁt Analysis (CBA) to acquire, convert
legacy and sustain TOs IAW ASD-S1000D and MIL-STD-3048. If the CBA does not support or justify development or
conversion to S1000D, TOs shall be developed in accordance with current TMSS. Program-speciﬁc TO requirements must
be identiﬁed using the S1000D Decision Point Tool located at https://techdata.wpafb.af.mil/tmss/index.html to identify
Program-speciﬁc functionality requirements and business rules, included in the program TMCR and documented in the
TOLCMP. The AFLCMC/LG TO Home Office must be consulted by the Program Office TOMA for advice, assistance, and
approval in developing, publishing and using these documents. In all cases of S1000D development, programs shall adhere
to MIL-STD-3048. Refer to https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12316.
3.26.1.1 The authoritative version of ASD-S1000D and MIL-STD-3048 are identiﬁed in the TMCR (Paragraph 3.6.1)
document. The CBA tools, TMCR template, USAF S1000D Decision Point Tool located at https://techdata.wpafb.af.mil/
tmss/index.html and TOLCMP template, are available on the TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
3.26.1.2 For modiﬁcation programs, if the CBA does not support or justify development or conversion to S1000D, TOs
shall be sustained in existing digital formats in compliance with current TMSS. Before converting legacy (existing) TO data
to a new authoring format, use and changeability must be considered. In many cases, converting hard-copy TOs to word-
searchable PDF ﬁles is sufficient for user needs, and is compatible with ETIMS distribution and viewing.
3.26.1.3 Type 2 Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) and Interactive Electronic Technical Publications
(IETPs) are currently exempt from distribution in ETIMS until such time as ETIMS becomes capable of handling these
eTOs. (See waiver procedures and format at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12837/default.aspx). As part of the Type 2 IETM/
S1000D based TO development process, the program office shall be responsible to establish and maintain a distribution
system capable of distributing the TOs. However, as the Type 2 IETM/S1000D TOs are developed, the TOMA shall index
them in ETIMS (-WA-2) so prospective users can begin establishing subscriptions. The ETIMS Catalog shall be maintained
by the TOMA for IETM/S1000D based TOs.
3.26.1.4 AF TO Programs desiring to implement S1000D/IETM initiatives shall utilize all available/applicable AF (APL)
tools and resources for the implementation and organic sustainment of IETM/S1000D tech data, i.e., Content Management
System (CMS), distribution and COTS/GOTS viewing software, etc. Systems and/or tools provided by the contractor shall
be made interoperable with AF infrastructure/technology.
3.26.1.5 S1000D/IETM programs currently utilizing contractor provided technology such as viewer software, distribution
systems and or content management solutions shall make every effort to migrate tech data into available/approved Air Force
solutions if technically interoperable and economically practical.
3.26.1.6 To deviate from AF TMSS or S1000D standards when acquiring, converting, or sustaining TOs, TOMAs must
request a program waiver through their PM, Lead Command/A4 and Center Home Office to HQ AFMC/A4. The request
must include a CBA showing authoritative savings over the life-cycle of the program and proof of compatibility with ETIMS
and all other AF information systems and product life cycle support databases.

TO 00-5-3
3.26.1.7 Legacy programs shall use AF TMSS SGML-tagging DTDs, without modiﬁcation, for sustainment of legacy
TMSS developed TOs. TO Revision updates to GML and TMSS SGML TOs shall be prepared to the most recently approved
standard, non-legacy version of TMSS DSS and corresponding output speciﬁcation. A waiver prepared according to Para-
graph 3.26.1.6 must be approved to deviate from this policy unless BCA (Paragraph 3.26.1) determines migration to S1000D
is more cost effective. AFLCMC/HIAM maintains a web site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12316/default.aspx) where all of the
standard DSS are maintained and made available to acquisition.
3.26.1.8 The following guidelines apply to DSS decisions:
3.26.1.8.1 When cost effective, always choose the new acquisition DSSs. This ensures TO data is delivered in the most
current AF format for immediate digital uses and allows efficient reformatting and reuse of the data.
3.26.1.8.2 Make full use of the hyper-linking capabilities that are provided in AF DSSs. These capabilities include full
and complete use of SGML constructs IDREF, XREF, EXTREF, EXREFID, HYTIME linking, and calls to external pro-
cesses wherever applicable in the data.
3.26.1.8.3 When a hyper-linking, Web browser-type application is required and the contractor is converting legacy TO
data that does not comply with the new acquisition TMSS, re-authoring may be required to apply appropriate structure
(primary paragraphs, subparagraphs, steps, etc.) and titles must be applied (created) where missing in the legacy TO, using
the new acquisition TMSS as a guide.
3.26.1.8.4 Ensure that page-oriented output produced for distribution from SGML (or other structured source formats) is
generated through use of the same publishing system that will be utilized for sustainment of the technical order data. Failure
to do so can result in increased printing and distribution costs since the output produced by different publishing systems
differs even when the same structured source data is utilized for publishing.
3.26.2 Development of Digital Support Suites. Contractors proposing use of commercial TM speciﬁcations or other
NGS, obsolete TMSS or TMSS with no Air Force DTD/schema and/or stylesheets available from AFLCMC/HIAM, may
develop DSS components needed for use as a ﬁnal resort. The contractor will be responsible to support the associated costs
of DTD and update for the usable lifetime of the DSS. The only exception is when AFLCMC/HIAM adopts the DSS for Air
Force use. If the acquiring organization authorizes the contractor to construct their own DTDs/schemas or DSS (including
stylesheets, such as XSLT, XSL-FO, CSS, and RSS), the contractor must contact AFLCMC/HIAM for guidance prior to
initiating the development process. The following procedures shall be followed:
3.26.2.1 Legacy programs shall use AF TMSS SGML-tagged DTDs, without modiﬁcation, for sustainment of legacy
TMSS developed TOs. AFLCMC/HIAM maintains a Web site where all of the standard DSS are maintained and made
available to acquisition (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12316/default.aspx). These DSS provide the SGML templates to be used,
and are part of the governing speciﬁcation or standard. The DSS categorized as new acquisition are the most current versions
of AF TMSS standards. Those DSS categorized as legacy are not as compliant to the current TMSS, but have options built
in to allow existing (legacy) TOs to be captured in a more standardized format using SGML. If the program requires
hyper-linked, interactive TOs, legacy DSS will not provide the desired outcome.
3.26.2.2 For TOs that will be delivered to the AF and organically maintained, the contractor must submit a proposed
complete DSS through the PCO and TOMA to AFLCMC/HIAM for approval to ensure complete compatibility with ETIMS
and the AF Viewer.
3.26.2.3 AFLCMC/HIAM is the AF approval agency for all non-AF DTDs/schemas and stylesheets to be used for AF
organic TO maintenance. Approved offeror-proposed speciﬁcations will be added to the program TMCR, by contract modi-
ﬁcation if necessary. DSS submitted and approved in execution of a contract become the property of the government.
EXCEPTIONS: DSS for Space and Missile TOs are managed and approved by AFSPC. If TOs are to be maintained by the
contractor for the life of the system, SGML and XML based tools developed for electronic TOs are not restrained to ETIMS
compatibility.
3.27 USE OF TECHNICAL MANUAL (TM) SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS (TMSS).
3.27.1 TMSS Selection. Preference shall be given to speciﬁcations and standards developed under DoDM 4120.24,
Defense Standardization Program (DSP) Procedures. Air Force TM Standards, MIL-DTL speciﬁcations (AF-TMSS) with
attached DTDs/schemas and stylesheets are required for TO acquisitions.

TO 00-5-3
3.27.1.1 When these are not available for a speciﬁc type of TO or a program decision has been made to use non-
government standards (except as noted in Paragraph 3.27.1.2), approval to use other government performance or non-
government (commercial) speciﬁcations and standards may be requested from HQ AFMC/A4F. The contractor may also
suggest or develop commercial substitutes for the approved government TMSS, but use is subject to Air Force approval.
RFPs and contracts must reﬂect this policy.
3.27.1.2 The TOMA must refer to the ASSIST database (http://quicksearch.dla.mil/) to ensure only the latest version
TMSS are placed on contract.
NOTE
Speciﬁcations/Standard Interface Records (SIRs) apply to programs in sustainment for new and changed TOs.
3.27.1.3 TMSS Approval. Only AF-approved MIL-STDs and MIL-SPECs listed in the TMCR should be used for Air
Force programs. Other military services’ TMSS which have NOT been adopted for Air Force use, but which otherwise meet
Acquisition Reform guidelines, may be used on joint-service programs when the TMSS will promote commonality and
reduce costs. Approval from the Air Force TMSS preparing activity (AFLCMC/HIAM) and a program-speciﬁc waiver from
HQ AFMC/A4F are required.
3.27.1.4 New TO Types. Submit proposals for new types of TOs (not identiﬁed in TO 00-5-1) to HQ AFMC/A4F, for
review and disposition. This does not apply to COTS manuals purchased under acquisition reform guidelines and included in
the TO system.
3.27.1.5 Upgrading TMSS. When revised speciﬁcations applicable to a program are published, the TOMA must review
them for impact to the program and, in conjunction with the contractor, using command and support agencies, determine if
a contract change should be initiated to incorporate the changes. Consider factors such as safety, usability, life-cycle cost and
schedule.
3.28 SPECIFICATION/STANDARD TAILORING, INTERPRETATION, DEVIATIONS AND WAIVERS.
3.28.1 Tailoring Guidance. Approved MILSPECs and MIL-STDs (TMSS) will be tailored by selecting from the ap-
proved options, but no other additions or deletions are authorized without written approval from the preparing activity,
provided IAW DoDM 4120.24. For AF TMSS, the preparing activity is AFLCMC/HIAM (or for space and missile TMSS,
AFSPC). Only formal DID revisions can add requirements to DIDs. DIDs may be tailored down by removing excess
requirements.
3.28.2 Tailoring Documentation. All TMSS tailoring will be documented in the Speciﬁcation/Standard Interface Record
(SIR) for that speciﬁcation or standard and included in the TMCR, by contract modiﬁcation, if necessary. Programs should
utilize the TMSS Tailoring Tool located at https://techdata.wpafb.af.mil/tmss/index.html to capture all tailoring requirements,
and attach the ﬁle output to the SIR section within their TMCR. The basic TMCR already contains SIRs specifying the
AF-only options for joint-service TMSS, but even these TMSS may be further tailored for a speciﬁc program. The Instruc-
tion to Offerors will direct the offeror to complete tailoring the joint-service TMSS, and add SIRs for other TMSS recom-
mended for the program. If revised TMSSs replace those on contract, new SIRs are also required.
3.28.3 TMSS Clariﬁcation. Contractors may request clariﬁcation of speciﬁcation requirements or government intent
through submission of Speciﬁcation Interpretation Documents (SID) responses which affect the scope of the contract will be
documented in the SIR.
3.28.4 Deviations and Waivers. Contractors may request the TOMA to apply to TO policy office (AFMC/A4F) for
deviations from or waivers to provisions in TMSS. These requests must include an objective justiﬁcation and evaluation of
the impact on: (1) time and material for the users (operating command and support agencies; (2) life-cycle cost of the
publication and equipment covered by the publication; (3) acquisition cost; and (4) preparation and/or delivery in digital
format. The TOMA will submit deviation and waiver requests IAW Paragraph 1.2.1. Approved requests will be documented
in the applicable SIR.
3.28.5 Copies. Copies of SIRs, SIDs and other program documents which could affect TMSS content will be provided to
AFLCMC/HIAM for information. (Appendix B.)

CHAPTER 4
TECHNICAL ORDER MANAGEMENT DURING SUSTAINMENT
4.1 TECHNICAL ORDER SUSTAINMENT.
At the completion of the technical order development and formalization process, the TO enters the sustainment phase of the
TO lifecycle. It is the responsibility of the Technical Order Manager/Agent (TOMA) to ensure the sustainment process is
implemented to ensure currency, completeness and accuracy for support of affected equipment until equipment disposal.
Sustainment includes: updating, numbering, indexing, publication (editing& printing), archiving and delivery to the user. The
TO content is managed by the Technical Content Manager (TCM) responsible for the equipment covered by the TO, as
identiﬁed in the ETIMS Catalog record. Printing, distribution, and overall sustainment management is controlled by the
assigned TOMA. The Technical Order Life Cycle Management Plan (TOLCMP) describes the TO sustainment activities. See
Paragraph 3.3.2.1 for TOLCMP requirements.
4.1.1 Functions and Corresponding Forms. All TO change recommendations and submittal methods are known collec-
tively as Recommended Changes (RCs).
4.1.1.1 Prepare TM Change Package Function. Approved RCs from all sources are aggregated by TOMA and once
approved by the TCM as source data, used by the TCM/TOMA to develop a TO update package that will document the exact
wording of approved changes for publication in the TO update. The following forms can be used to initiate a recommended
change:
4.1.1.2 AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and Reply. TO 00-5-1 contains practices
and detailed instructions for initiating, reviewing and evaluating AFTO Form 22. Completed forms are submitted via email
IAW Paragraph 5.5.4 and, if approved, an AFTO Form 252 is prepared by the TCM.
4.1.1.3 AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. AFI 11-215 contains policy and procedures for
use of AF Form 847 for submitting changes to Flight Manual Program (FMP) TOs.
4.1.1.4 AFTO Form 27, Preliminary Technical Order (PTO) Publication Change Request (PCR)/TO Veriﬁcation
Record/Approval. Chapter 3 contains policy and procedures for use of AFTO Form 27 to report discrepancies or recom-
mend improvements to Preliminary TOs. AFTO Form 27 shall also be used for the approval of veriﬁcation completion for
revisions, if necessary. The AFTO Form 252 process should not be used to submit proposed changes for preliminary TOs or
record veriﬁcation of preliminary TOs.
4.1.1.5 Source, Maintenance and Recoverability (SMR) Code Change Request. Submit an AFTO Form 22 IAW
TO 00-5-1 and TO 00-20-3, Maintenance Processing of Reparable Property and The Repair Cycle Asset Control System.
Once a recommendation for SMR code change is approved, the TCM will submit an AFTO Form 252 for updating the TO.
4.1.1.6 AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and Reply. Depot maintenance activities
will use the AFMC Form 202 to request and receive technical data for procedures and repairs beyond existing TO authority,
IAW AFMCMAN 21-1, Air Force Materiel Command Technical Order system Procedures.
4.1.1.7 AFTO Form 252, Technical Order Publication Change Request. The AFTO Form 252 is the official form to
direct changes to AF TOs. An AFTO Form 252 can include content from one or more approved RCs or can be internally
generated by the TCM/FMM. The AFTO Form 252 provides word-for-word instructions on how the TO will be updated. See
Figure 4-1 for completion instructions. Each internally generated AFTO Form 252 will have a unique Local Control Number
(LCN). An RC-generated AFTO Form 252 will inherit the Control Number of original RC.
NOTE
For Technical Management Information System (TMIS) users, use of TMIS system generated LCNs are autho-
rized.

4.1.1.7.2 When discrepancies are detected during the Data Vault construction effort (mining existing IPBs to build the Bill
of Materials (BOM) for weapon systems, components and equipment), they will be documented on AFTO Form 252 with
LCNs beginning with four (4). This will allow tracking these discrepancies apart from other TO issues.
4.1.1.7.3 When implementing Item Unique Identiﬁcation (IUID) instructions, the LCN will begin with three (3) on any
associated AFTO 22 or AFTO 252. This will allow tracking IUID-related updates apart from other TO issues.
4.1.1.8 AFTO Form Special Handling (SH) 252. Special Handling (SH) AFTO Form 252 may be issued to expedite a
permanent change or RAC to a TO as a result of an AFMC Form 202 that was used to prevent a work stoppage at a depot
repair facility. A formal TO change must be distributed within 120 days of an approved AFMC Form 202. If the 120 day
formal TO change time limit cannot be met, an IOS coversheet (Figure 4-2 ) will be created by the TOMA concurrent with
the SH252. The SH252 will be attached, the IOS will be published within the 120 day period and will remain active until the
formal change can be accomplished.
4.1.1.9 IETM/S1000D Change Process. In some cases, IETM/S1000D RCs may be a built-in function of the IETM/
S1000D database, which will identify where the deﬁciency is in the database. Non-database RCs must identify the location
of the data to be updated within the database. In most cases, this will be a step within a task, or an illustration/table. If
necessary for clarity, a screen print or digital annotation of the deﬁcient data will be submitted with the RC.
4.1.1.10 Item Unique Identiﬁcation (IUID)-Related TO Updates.
4-2

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_90
TO 00-5-3
4.1.1.10.1 Engineering Changes. If an IUID-related, engineering change is processed on a component, subcomponent,
assembly, or sub-assembly (generically a part) and a published TO speciﬁes the overhaul, remanufacture, repair (or assem-
bly) of that part, that TO shall be updated to specify the processes and location for marking the item by IUID.
• The IUID marking method shall (in detail or by reference to other TOs) include all inspection procedures, part
surface preparation procedures, all marked application procedures, and (unless marked with direct part marking) the
data label, data plate, or IUID label part number (e.g. 200945085-XX).
• The marking location speciﬁed in the TO shall be speciﬁc to the part and shall include sufficient detail to reﬂect the
location and tolerances speciﬁed in the Engineering Order (EO). In the case of multiple parts with the same
conﬁguration (e.g. multiple avionics boxes with the same top level assembly), a common ﬁgure with multiple
references may be used.
• Program offices may delay IUID-related updates to TOs which are not intended for AFMC depot use.
4.1.1.10.2 Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB). If the IPB is contained in a separate -4 (i.e., not in the repair manual),
then the IPB is not to be used to specify the location or the method for marking a part with IUID. If applying IUID to a part
changes a part number in the IPB (e.g., if a new data plate is speciﬁed which differs from the existing data plate called out
in the IPB), then the IPB shall be updated to show IUID; otherwise, the IPB need not be updated to show IUID label location
or part number.
4.1.1.10.3 Implementation. TO updates associated with IUID instructions shall be implemented IAW standard proce-
dures, except as noted below:
• For those IUID instructions which are required against TOs which are only distributed in paper distribution media
format, the TO update shall be implemented as a Special Handling 252 (SH252). These IUID SH252s shall contain
all of the TO-required information, and may be allowed to remain separate from the TO (i.e. not drive a TO change)
for up to 26 months.
• For those IUID instructions which are required against TOs which are distributed in any other distribution media
format or combination, the TO update shall be made via standard methods except that implementation may be
delayed by up to six months. This additional delay will allow the grouping of IUID-driven instructions and will
minimize TO change costs.
4.1.1.11 Special Packaging Instruction (SPI) Related TO Updates. TO updates which may require changes in SPI
must be coordinated with the center packaging specialists IAW AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo.
4.1.1.12 Veriﬁcation of TOs During Sustainment. All TO updates during sustainment shall be veriﬁed unless waived by
the Program Manager (PM) IAW AFI 63-101/20-101. Veriﬁcation procedures to be used during the TO sustainment phase of
the program life cycle will be documented in the TOLCVP by the TOMA. The TOLCVP is mandatory for all programs. See
Paragraph 3.3.2.2 for TOLCVP requirements.
4.1.1.12.1 Reveriﬁcation after Digital Format Conversion. Reverify previously veriﬁed source data or TOs converted
into a digital format, to ensure that the data has been captured or converted accurately by the capture or conversion process
(i.e., there was no distortion of graphics or alteration of the text; changes to the ﬂow of the data between steps or tasks; or
mismatching of the relationships or references within the data). Verify that the mark-ups applied to add intelligence (if any)
were applied correctly to the converted data IAW the Air Force TMSS or the adopted/approved commercial standard(s).
Most importantly, verify the data to ensure accuracy of applied effectivities (e.g., equipment conﬁguration, users skill levels,
etc.)
4.1.1.12.2 Some converted data may require hands-on veriﬁcation. Hands-on veriﬁcation will be determined by the
acquiring activity. Instances where hands-on veriﬁcation may be required are:
• When a task required signiﬁcant change in logical ﬂow;
• When a sampling of tasks has been agreed to by the acquiring activity and the users; or
• When a task is identiﬁed by the acquiring activity, user or contractor as questionable after conversion.
4-3

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_91
TO 00-5-3
4.1.1.12.3 Post-Digital Conversion Veriﬁcation Procedures. Veriﬁcation of TOs and data converted to a digital format
will be accomplished by desktop comparison of the conversion instance to the source data to determine the accuracy of the
conversion and data capture processes:
• Verify logical ﬂow of procedures within the digital conversion ﬁle to ensure accuracy of the ﬂow of text, steps and
procedures, effectivity, and to ensure Warnings, Cautions, and Notes are displayed where required.
- In some instances, logical ﬂow may be enhanced
to provide additional detail or direction to the
user; therefore, logical ﬂow must be 100% re-
veriﬁed.
- Verify all conditional branches when variable
user inputs branch the logical ﬂow.
- Verify dialog box text and response display.
- Verify correct graphics and hot spots are dis-
played for individual steps.
- Verify correct application of novice and expert
delineations if applicable.
- For Illustrated Parts Breakdown conversion, in
addition to verifying clarity and correctness of
graphics, ensure correct application of effectivi-
ties and accuracy of converted parts information
to include Notes, Alternate Part Numbers, SMR
Codes, Cage Codes, and Units per Assembly.
Ensure accurate conversion of non-displayed
parts.
- For digital Wiring Diagrams (WDs), ensure com-
plete/accurate/undistorted conversion of all wir-
ing lines, symbols and reference designators. If
the wiring information is interactive, ensure ac-
curacy of interactivity to include signal ﬂow,
correct depiction of component operation (i.e.
switches, fuses, relays) and correct wiring infor-
mation display based on effectivity.
- When verifying -6 Inspection TOs and check-
lists, ensure similarly-worded steps are all pres-
ent and correctly sequenced.
• Ensure all links added to enhance the relation-
ships between items in the source data reference
the correct data, and no broken links exist in the
converted data instance.
• Verify functionality of software/data interaction
IAW contract requirements (TMCR, SOW, etc.).
• Parse the instance against the target speciﬁcation
Document Type Deﬁnitions (DTDs) to ensure
markup tags added to the data are accurate and
comply with the DTD.
• Perform analysis of the composed document
from the marked-up instance using the desig-
nated composition engine, to determine the com-
pliance of the printed or viewed output (only
required if paper pages or digital views will also
be produced from the instance).
4.1.1.12.4 Use the certiﬁcation process and tools of the conversion contractor to reduce reveriﬁcation requirements if
appropriate. Contractor certiﬁcation processes and tools must ﬁrst be analyzed for accuracy and completeness before adop-
tion in the government reveriﬁcation process.

TO 00-5-3
4.1.1.12.5 MAJCOMs will support reveriﬁcation efforts by providing subject matter experts when requested, to assist/
perform desktop analysis.
4.1.2 Processing Technical Order Recommended Changes (RCs). (Figure 4-3) RCs and updates are categorized as
Emergency, Urgent or Routine (TO 00-5-1). Base the update category on its impact to the system or commodity mission
effectiveness, safety or maintainability. Limit Emergency and Urgent submittals to technical and safety-related changes.
Hold nontechnical changes to paper TOs for implementation with routine technical updates on the affected or backing pages.
All updates to TOs distributed and used only in digital format should be incorporated into the master TO ﬁle prior to
distribution. Updates must be published within the time limits speciﬁed in Table 4-1. Changes to report categories will not be
made without the express concurrence of the TOMA and the submitting MAJCOM.
4.1.2.1 General. The following provides the requirements for the processing of RCs received on any of the above forms.
4.1.2.2 Emergency RCs. Emergency recommendations require immediate action on a TO deﬁciency which, if not
corrected, WOULD result in a fatality or serious injury to personnel, extensive damage or destruction of equipment or
property, or inability to achieve or maintain operational posture (MISSION ESSENTIAL), including ﬁeld-level work stop-
page. In addition, emergency includes discrepancies that directly affect the handling, maintenance, operations, transportation,
and testing or storage of nuclear weapons. The TOMA/TCM or designated representative must provide written corrective
action or downgrade the RC within 48 hours (72 hours for work stoppage) of receipt.
4.1.2.3 Urgent RCs. Urgent recommendations require action on a TO deﬁciency which, if not corrected, COULD cause
one or more of the following: personnel injury; damage to equipment or property; reduce operational efficiency, and/or
jeopardize the safety or success of mission accomplishment. Submit RCs that could result in over $25,000 or 1000 man-
hours annual savings to the Air Force as urgent. All technical TCTO deﬁciencies are submitted as urgent. Identiﬁcation of or
replacements for EPA Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) and ODS are submitted as urgent. In addition, urgent includes all
other discrepancies that indirectly affect a nuclear weapon and technical orders that indirectly affect the handling, mainte-
nance, operations, transportation, training, and testing or storage of nuclear weapons. The TOMA/TCM or designated
representative must provide written corrective action or downgrade the RC within 40 days of receipt.
4.1.2.4 Routine RCs. All other recommendations for update/improvement not requiring emergency or urgent action will
be submitted electronically as routine RCs. The TOMA/TCM or designated representative must reply to routine reports
within 45 calendar days of receipt, advising or action taken and the reason when disapproved.
4.1.2.5 TO Updates for Obsolete Systems and Commodities.
NOTE
Technical Order Page Supplements (TOPS) shall
not be used to update TOs for any reason.
Obsolete systems and commodities include those still in limited use or scheduled to leave the inventory within two years.
Users will continue to submit routine recommended changes for TOs on obsolete systems and commodities. However, the
TOMA/TCM will hold recommended changes in abeyance pending the decision to rescind or update the TO. The TOMA
will provide an adequate schedule for updating the affected TOs when no review is scheduled. In these cases, the updates
will normally be published as ITOs. The TOMA will make Emergency and Urgent updates as usual.
4.1.2.6 TOMA Procedures. Upon receipt, managers will process RCs within the time limits speciﬁed in Table 4-1.
Managers will establish routine update schedules for all assigned TOs, depending upon data criticality and volatility, and
which meet the Table 4-1 time limits. Aggregate all routine RCs received after the cutoff date (publication freeze date) of the
previous update and prior to the cutoff for the next update into a single update package for each TO. The action or response
time periods for each RC begin with receipt of the RC by the responsible TOMA. The periods end when an update is
distributed or the RC is disapproved or determined to be a duplicate submission.
4.1.2.6.1 Exceptions to Evaluation Time. Recommended Changes (RCs) placed in Abeyance, Advisement or Deferred
status (TO 00-5-1) are exempt from evaluation time limits speciﬁed in Table 4-1

4.1.2.6.2 SAP/FMS Procedures. The above policy does not apply to AFTO Form 22 that are submitted against CSTOs
and received from foreign countries. Under the Security Assistance Program (including FMS), there are contractual arrange-
ments to maintain the currency of the respective CSTOs. Refer to TO 00-5-19 for more information.
4.1.2.6.3 RC Receipt. Enter the Receipt Date from the AFTO Form 22 and digitally sign Block 4. Ensure the form was
routed IAW the standard AF and MAJCOM routing procedures posted on the Tech Order Recommended Change Processing
SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10903/default.aspx. Return incomplete RCs to the PIM (or equivalent) in Block
1. Organizational email accounts at MAJCOM and Lead Command CCPs should follow the procedures at Paragraph 5.5.4.5
to exchange AFTO Form 22 transmitted via signed and encrypted email.
4.1.2.6.4 Evaluation. Evaluate RCs recommending publication style and format changes, minor typographical errors or
new types of TOs, and forward RCs recommending TO technical content changes to the TCM for further evaluation IAW
TO 00-5-1. Return an updated copy of all RCs to the PIM (or equivalent) in Block 1 and reviewing agencies to provide
status.
4.1.2.6.5 Non-TO Deﬁciencies. Disapprove RCs submitted on computer program or equipment deﬁciencies and refer the
initiator to TO 00-35D-54, USAF Deﬁciency Reporting and Investigating System, for reporting non-TO deﬁciencies. Also,
disapprove RCs determined to be ineligible IAW TO 00-5-1, Chapter 9, Technical Order Change Process, including multiple
RCs submitted to correct a single deﬁciency.
4.1.2.7 Recommended Changes Applicable to Multiple TOs. The TCM responsible for preparing a change package to
any TO shall make every effort to identify all affected TOs, and coordinate with and submit corresponding changes to the
other responsible TCMs.
4.1.3 TO Change Package Requirements.
4.1.3.1 TOMA Procedures. Users shall refer to the AF TOMA SharePoint site for a link (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/
10531) to speciﬁc TO Site Functional Office Change Package processes and workﬂows, or contact the applicable TO Site
Functional Office. TOMAs shall follow the approved local procedures approved by their TO Site Functional Office for
processing all recommendations for change. These procedures must also address all RACs, Interim Safety and Operational
Supplements and the process to formalize these interims.
NOTE
RCs (and ITOs) to be included in a TO update
must be entered on the AFTO Form 252 to pre-
pare a TO change package.
4.1.3.2 TCM Procedures. The TCM identiﬁed in the ETIMS Catalog record will consolidate approved TO change
packages from all sources affecting the same TO. Include all approved technical RCs prior to the time limit speciﬁed in
Table 4-1. Routine editorial RCs (typos, nontechnical changes, etc.) to paper TOs, not affecting TO understanding and
compliance, may be held until the affected page or backing page is updated for technical changes. RCs include both
TCM-generated changes and user-submitted changes.
4.1.3.2.1 In conjunction with the TOMA, review and update the TO Classiﬁcation and distribution limitation statements as
required.
NOTE
The actual Reading Grade Level (RGL) can be
computed automatically by many word process-
ing and publishing software packages.
4.1.3.2.2 The TCM will prepare an AFTO Form 124, Computation of Technical Order RGL (AFTO Form 252, Block 15),
based on criteria speciﬁed below:
4-6

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_94
TO 00-5-3
• Compute RGL on the entire text when more than 25% of the original text is changed. Exclude original text if the
change adds new sections and/or chapters. Example: TO 2J-F100-6, Chapters 1 through 9 (original text) – The
addition of Chapter 10 would not require recheck of Chapters 1 through 9.
• Compute RGL on only the changed text when changing two or more consecutive pages of text.
• Do not compute RGL if changing two or less consecutive pages of text.
• Review existing commercial manuals for RGL. Do not reject or re-write the manuals solely for RGL.
• MIL-STD-38784 speciﬁes an RGL of 9 for Air Force TOs.
NOTE
The MIL-STD-38784 required grade level can be
tailored during the contracting process.
4.1.3.2.3 The TCM will obtain an Environmental Assessment if there are any environmental impacts (see AFI 32-7061,
The Environmental Impact Analysis Process) (AFTO Form 252, Block 16).
4.1.3.3 Routing and Coordination. Route the AFTO Form 252 change package as follows:
4.1.3.3.1 If the change contents have changed the releasability of the TO, the TCM must coordinate the changes with
applicable STINFO, Security, Legal, FDO and PA offices, as required, to validate or change distribution limitations for both
the change or revision and the basic TO (Block 11). Ensure Interim TOs (IOS or ISS) carry only the restrictions required by
the contents (may not be the same as the basic TO).
4.1.3.3.2 The applicable Chief Engineer (CE) or PM will ensure coordination on all change packages affecting personnel
or equipment safety. Bioenvironmental Engineering will coordinate on procedures affecting personnel health (involving
noise, heat, air contaminants, chemicals, radiation, lasers, thermal stresses, biological and ergonomic hazards, etc.) (Block
12).
4.1.3.3.3 Obtain a Nuclear Surety Technical Evaluation on change packages affecting Nuclear Surety Procedures (NSP) or
Hardness Critical Items (HCI) (Block 13).
4.1.3.3.4 Indicate whether the proposed updates will require veriﬁcation, and the type of veriﬁcation required (Block 17).
The veriﬁcation results may be recorded in either Block 18 or Block 21C (after the last data change entry).
4.1.3.3.5 The specialized functions listed in TO 00-5-1, Table 9-1 (e.g., Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI), Corrosion
Control, Life Support, Civil Engineer Readiness, etc.), will coordinate on change packages affecting the assigned areas of
responsibility (Block 18).
NOTE
AFMC organizations designated to provide Level 3 NDI services may provide NDI coordination, but an electronic
copy of the submission SHALL be provided to the AF NDI Program Office (AFLCMC/EZPT-NDIO) at the
organizational email address afrl.mls-ol3@us.af.mil.
4.1.3.3.6
Coordinate change package which may be applicable to military systems or commodities operated by foreign
governments (e.g., FMS and European Participating Air Force (EPAF)). For those countries that are participants of a Foreign
Military Sales Technical Coordination Group (TCG) the change packages shall be submitted to the applicable TCG for
review for determination of applicability to the Country Standard Technical Orders (CSTOs). For those countries that are not
participants of a TCG, the change packages shall be routed through the Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation
Directorate (Block 18). AFSAC-D Country Managers initiate development of related updates to CSTOs.
4.1.3.3.7 Coordinate change packages impacting commodity items managed by other Product Groups with the responsible
group (Block 18).
4-7

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_95
TO 00-5-3
4.1.3.3.8 Coordinate RCs against end-item TOs managed by an SPD, which affect commodities assigned to a Product
Group Manager (PGM), with the affected PGM (Block 18).
4.1.3.3.9 Coordinate changes to MPTOs affecting policy and procedures with the AF OPR for that policy or procedure
(Block 18).
4.1.3.4 Originator’s Data. The initiator (TCM or other function) will enter their data (Block 19), and sign the AFTO
Form 252 using their Computer Access Card (CAC) certiﬁcate or, in the case of system generated forms, the system will
maintain a record of evidence of signature.
4.1.3.5 Approval Signature. The PM or designee (typically the CE) will check technical and procedural changes to
ensure the accuracy and adequacy of the TO update. (This step is required even if individual RCs had already been reviewed,
because of possible interactions between different proposed changes.) The CE or designee will sign Block 20 of the AFTO
Form 252 using his/her CAC certiﬁcate or, in the case of system generated forms, the system will maintain a record of
evidence of signature. For non-system and non-equipment TOs, the TCM’s supervisor will sign (Block 20) or delegate the
responsibility to the TCM.
4.1.3.6 Early Implementation. TO users shall not implement approved RCs until the interim supplement or formal TO
update is available, except as follows:
4.1.3.6.1 AFTO Form 252 generated from AFTO Form 22 initiated by the AF Primary Standards Laboratory (AFPSL), or
issued against TMDE TOs or ICBM Depot Control Manuals, may be implemented upon approval, when early implementa-
tion is requested and justiﬁed by the initiator. If early implementation is approved, the TCM will enter Approved for
Implementation in the disposition block of the RC.
4.1.3.6.2 Updates approved for early implementation in Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM/S1000D based
TOs) will be merged with the IETM/S1000D database and published electronically by the TOMA IAW procedures in
Paragraph 5.4.
4.1.4 Technical Order Update Practices. In keeping with the Air Force digital TO vision, and the Technical Order
Concept of Operation (TO CONOPS) providing technically accurate and up-to-date digital technical data at the point of use
that is acquired, sustained, distributed and available in digital format digital (WA-1), TO subscriptions will be established for
ETIMS eTOs instead of physical distribution TO (i.e., paper or CD/DVDs). Revisions will exclusively be used to update
TOs which are only distributed in WA-1 digital format.
EXCEPTIONS:
• An emergency recommended change to
a.pdf only TO may be implemented as a
merged supplement instead of a revision.
• An emergency recommended change to
html TOs with no paper versions may be
implemented as a RAC instead of a revi-
sion.
• Where an IOS is being published in sup-
port of the depot SH252 process (Para-
graph 4.1.1.8) for a pdf only TO, the IOS
will be implemented as a merged supple-
ment.
• Where an IOS is being published in sup-
port of the depot SH252 process (Para-
graph 4.1.1.8) for a database-structured
IETM, the IOS will be implemented as a
non-merged supplement. Upon receipt,
the TODO ﬁles the IOS as a private in-
crement on the local device.
4.1.4.1 Routine Changes and Supplements. Routine changes and supplements must be authored and published using
the same software application as the basic TO.
4-8

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_96
TO 00-5-3
4.1.4.2 Revisions. For TOs distributed in paper or in both paper and digital format, TOMAs will determine whether to
update as a change or revision ( Paragraph 4.1.4.2.2 and Paragraph 4.1.4.2.3).
4.1.4.2.1 Revisions to GML and TMSS SGML TOs shall be prepared to the most recently approved standard, non-legacy
version of TMSS DSS and corresponding output speciﬁcation.
4.1.4.2.2 Paper TO Updates. When TO changes have paper distribution, the change must be merged with the baseline
TO ﬁle, uploaded and indexed as a revision (WA-1) in ETIMS. TOs on CDs and DVDs will normally require update by a
replacement medium containing either merged TO/change ﬁles or revised TOs (no supplements). Transition to digital only
distribution will be pursued when paper distribution waiver criteria is not met per Paragraph 5.4.3.
NOTE
If a distributed CD contains multiple TOs, the CD will be redistributed in its entirety when any of the TOs are
updated.
4.1.4.2.3 Consider a revision to TOs distributed in paper or in both paper and digital formats when the following condi-
tions are met:
• When 70 percent or more of the basic paper TO (including the current update) has been changed.
• When there is a change to equipment conﬁguration, compliance with new military speciﬁcations, etc.
• When updating brief TOs (20 or fewer pages), unless the change will be issued as difference data sheets.
• When a TO publication is being declassiﬁed by removing classiﬁed data, to prevent issuing warehouse stocks
marked as classiﬁed. Exceptions are authorized. TOs may be declassiﬁed by issuing a TO change if cost effective.
• When the TO is a combined manual (e.g., Maintenance with Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB), etc.) and has an
abbreviated title page and no A page.
4.1.4.2.3.1 TOs which have transitioned, or are planned for transition to WA only distribution, should undergo revision
when the following conditions are met:
• When the system or commodity will remain in service for 2 years or more.
• When the TO has supplements which have not been incorporated for 1 year or more.
• When the TO has greater than 6 outstanding changes.
• When the format of the publication does not promote clarity and usability when viewed on an eTool.
4.1.4.2.3.2 Updates to brief TOs (20 or fewer pages) shall be accomplished by revision only.
4.1.4.2.4 Do not revise TOs distributed in paper or in both paper and digital format when the following conditions are
met:
• The system or commodity will be removed from the inventory within two years (Paragraph 4.1.2.5).
• The paper TO is usable as is (even if 100% of the pages have changed over a period of time).
4.1.4.3 New or Revised Technical Manual Speciﬁcations and Standards (TMSS). The TOMA determines whether
or not to issue a TO revision when the governing MILSPEC or MIL-STD used to prepare the TO is revised. The TOMA may
direct contractors who will revise the TO to use a later version of the governing speciﬁcations when there will be no change
in contract costs. Any such direction affecting contract cost must be coordinated with the PCO before going to the contractor.
4-9

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_97
TO 00-5-3
4.1.4.4 Numbering Changes and Revisions. The TOMA assigns an identifying number to each TO change and revision
being published, using the ETIMS Manage TO Detail screen. The TO change number will appear on the title page and each
page containing changed data. The revision number identiﬁes the version or edition of the TO and will not be printed on the
TO Title page except when indicated in the Supersedure Notice. The TOMA should initially check the Available for Index in
the ETIMS TO record.
4.1.4.5 Technical Order Sustainment Pre-Publication Reviews. The ﬁnal draft (reproduction copy or digital ﬁle) of
TO updates developed as part of sustainment must receive a pre-publication review for technical accuracy, currency and
adequacy (depth of coverage); by the TCM and TOMA; as well as conformance to MILSPEC requirements prior to
distribution. The review shall be jointly conducted by the TOMA and the TCM, with the assistance of other Subject Matter
Experts (SME) as required. This pre-pub review may replace veriﬁcation by Desk-Top Analysis. During Technical Order
Sustainment Pre-Publication Reviews, the following items, as a minimum, should be checked:
• Accuracy of Title Page information - dates, supersedure notice, distribution limitations, etc., against information
about the TO Update in the TO Index record.
• Accuracy of the List of Effective Pages (LEP).
• Procedures and illustrations for technical accuracy, completeness and readability.
• Compliance to MILSPEC format.
• Changed page numbering and markings.
• Publication date should be within 30 days of distribution date. Publication Date shall be adjusted due to publication
delays, issuance of supplements or receipt of urgent changes. In all cases, the publication date shall be later than all
previously released increments (basic, revisions, changes, and supplements).
• Coordination with affected functional areas - Engineering, Safety, Nuclear Surety, Bio-Environmental Engineering.
4.1.4.5.1 TO development or support contracts should allow for TOMA review and approval of draft TOs before delivery
of ﬁnal copy to the government. If the information in the draft must be published immediately, any serious technical errors
in the review copy may be corrected with a RAC or an interim safety or operational supplement that is distributed concur-
rently with the TO. Concurrently released RACs or supplements must be dated at least one day apart. Correct less critical
errors through the routine update process.
4.1.4.5.2 For updates published in-house (organically), errors shall be corrected prior to submitting the reproduction copy
in TODPG.
4.1.4.6 Technical Order Post-Publication Reviews. Perform post-publication reviews to evaluate and improve formal
TOs after delivery to the MAJCOM. There are two types of post-publication reviews: TOMA or TCM post-publication
reviews and currency reviews. During each review, manuals which are published in paper format should be evaluated for
conversion to solely digital distribution.
4.1.4.6.1 TOMA or TCM Post-Publication Reviews. These reviews are conducted after TOs have been delivered to the
MAJCOM to evaluate and correct the instructions contained in the TOs. The need to conduct a PPR will be determined by
the TOMA or TCM based upon equipment modiﬁcations, AFTO Form 22 or AF Form 847 received, or MAJCOM or PM
recommendations. Participants may include the TOMA, TCM, and MAJCOM representatives.
4.1.4.6.2 Distribution Statements and other STINFO markings will be evaluated to ensure the appropriate distribution
audience. Action should be taken to correct deﬁciencies in Distribution Statements (Paragraph 2.1.4.17) or other STINFO
related Title Page Information.
4.1.4.6.3 Currency Reviews. Currency reviews are performed to ensure that the TO enables the safe, appropriate and
effective maintenance and operation of equipment. TOs that are complete and document best practices will increase the
operational readiness of systems. The responsible TCM will:
4.1.4.6.3.1 Review unclassiﬁed TOs that have not been updated for ﬁve years for currency, distribution limitation changes,
etc.
4-10

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_98
TO 00-5-3
4.1.4.6.3.2 Review classiﬁed TOs at every update, but no less than annually, for currency and possible reclassiﬁcation.
4.1.4.6.3.3 In addition to the TO content, ETIMS Catalog data and cross-reference data, including work cards, must also
be veriﬁed for accuracy.
4.1.4.6.3.4 Table 4–4 may be used as a reference to ensure the TO is complete, accurate and up to date with current
practices.
4.1.4.7 Periodic Deferral Review. If publication of routine changes or revisions must be deferred for any reason, the
TCM, in coordination with the TOMA, must review the publication package every 90 days from the date of the deferral
decision for possible priority upgrading.
4.1.4.7.1 Base the upgrade decision on the potential to negatively affect OSS&E of the military system or commodity
resulting from continued publication delays. The TCM/TOMA should consider such things as negative maintenance trends,
increased occurrence of safety incidents and the cumulative effects of aggregated changes which, if not addressed, are made
worse by unpublished TO updates.
4.1.4.7.2 Only those portions of the change package actually requiring upgrade will be extracted from the package and
published as an IOS or ISS, pending routine publication of the formal change or revision. If the entire package must be
upgraded, publish the formal update within the upgraded priority category timelines. The TOMA shall coordinate Interim
TOs with the TCM and Lead Command prior to issue.
4.1.4.8 Formal Supplements. Develop formal Safety and Operational Supplements (SS&OS)
IAW MIL-STD-
38784. EXCEPTION : The text of formal Safety Supplements shall be black, NOT red, for readability reasons. Before
issuing formal Emergency or Urgent TO supplements which will restrict any Air Force system from full capability or
operational readiness, the Interim TO Advance Notiﬁcation requirements of Paragraph 4.2.1.7 must be implemented.
4.1.4.9 TO Updates Related to TCTOs. The TCM/FMM will update TOs and FMP publications affected by TCTOs,
and the TOMA will release the updates concurrently with the driving TCTO (IAW TO 00-5-15). TCTO-related TO updates
containing both‘before’ and ‘after’ data may be published up to 180 days prior to the TCTO itself. See Paragraph 5.1.8 for
TODPG processes related to managing the concurrent release and delivery of paper media.
4.1.4.10 Joint Service TMs. The Air Force OPR of a Joint Service TM managed by another service (Army, Navy, etc.)
will issue an Air Force-only supplement to change Air Force compliance with procedures in a TM managed by another
service. Coordination with the other service is not required when the changes affect only the Air Force, but a copy of the
supplement will be provided to the lead service TM Manager for information. If the change is subsequently incorporated into
the TM, the AF supplement will be rescinded. When the Air Force is the lead service, the TOMA must fully coordinate
proposed updates with all affected services prior to publication.
4.1.4.11 Country Standard TO (CSTO) Updates. The equipment contractor normally produces CSTO updates under an
FMS contract. See TO 00-5-19 for further details.
4.1.4.12 Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) Manuals. When AF personnel are authorized to access and use manuals from
FAA online, the AF TCM will author an Identifying Technical Publication Sheet (ITPS) to 1) authorize the use of the speciﬁc
FAA manual 2) provide FAA online accessing instructions for the speciﬁc manual 3) direct AF personnel to monitor FAA
online for currency as the ETIMS subscription to the ITPS will only alert them to changes in the ITPS. The TOMA will
number and index the ITPS in ETIMS as a Sponsor Approval, WA-1 eTO, upload the optimized PDF ﬁle into ETIMS and
manage subscription requests.
4.1.5 Digital Technical Order Supplement Procedures. TOMAs will merge all supplements to include making all
required annotations to the TO and supplement. TOMAs shall also link items in supplement, and may bookmark. For
guidance with these processes, use the Functional Users Guide (FUG) provided on the TOMA SharePoint site at https://
cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
4.1.5.1 Development. Develop the supplement using a word-processing or publishing software program (formatted and
numbered IAW TO 00-5-1). Convert it to PDF using Acrobat Distiller™ or PDF Writer™ (part of Adobe® Acrobat).
4-11

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_99
TO 00-5-3
4.1.5.2 Posting Supplements to Basic TO File. The TOMA will download the TO ﬁle from its distribution medium
(Internet or CD-ROM/DVD), open the ﬁle using Adobe® Acrobat™ and attach the supplement ﬁle as described in the FUG
on the Air Force Technical Order Managers SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
4.1.5.3 Indexing and Distribution. Index the supplement as a printed copy in ETIMS, and index the merged digital TO as
a revision with the same publish date as the supplement. Upload the TO ﬁle with notes and attached supplement to the
distribution medium. Interim changes to a TO distributed on CD-ROM might be uploaded on a web site for immediate
access, with notiﬁcation provided to users IAW Chapter 5. Refer to TO 00-5-15 for a listing of special distribution addresses
for ITO messages.
4.1.5.4 Supplementing IETM/S1000D Based TOs. IETM/S1000D based TOs and SGML-tagged ﬁles shall not be
supplemented. (See EXCEPTIONS Paragraph 4.1.4).
4.1.5.5 Digital Flight Manual Supplement Procedures. TOMAs will merge all FM supplements to include linking and
making all required annotations to the TO and supplement. For guidance with these processes, use the FUG provided on the
TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
4.1.5.5.1 Digital Flight Manual Supplements Applied to Checklist Pages. Per AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals
Program, ﬂight crew checklists can only be supplemented by a supplement to the parent TO. Interim supplements to the
parent TO affecting ﬂight crew checklists will authorize write-in changes to the affected checklist. Formal supplements to the
parent TO will provide checklist insert pages. In either case, to complete the update process for digital eTOs, the FMM will
provide the TOMA PDF insert pages formatted IAW MIL-DTL-7700. The title page will be annotated to show the supple-
ment and date information from the parent TO. The TOMA will merge the pages into the checklist. No linking will be
required since the title page will be the original page as no supplement was released against the checklist, and there will not
be separate steps to link.
4.1.5.5.2
taining the insert pages will be uploaded and validated, and will be manually deployed using normal processes.
The checklist not containing the insert pages will be removed from the ETIMS repository, the checklist con-
4.1.6 CD-ROM/DVD Procedures.
4.1.6.1 Responsibilities. The TOMA for a CD-ROM/DVD, with coordination from the PM and Lead Command, is
responsible for CD-ROM/DVD content, numbering, indexing, updating, publication, packaging, labeling, and distribution.
Classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed TOs will not be mixed on a single disk. The TOMA will determine routine CD/DVD update
intervals, in conjunction with the Lead Command and the TOMA of the individual TOs included on the disk. If a separate
content manager is assigned for the disc, some of these duties may be delegated to that function.
NOTE
• The use of CD-ROMs/DVDs for unclassiﬁed digital TO distribution and use is being phased out as ETIMS
distribution and use is implemented. Classiﬁed digital TOs may continue to use CDs/DVDs.
• The same general rules that apply to CD-ROMs used to publish and distribute TO ﬁles will apply to DVDs,
pending development of a DVD speciﬁc publication.
• AFCEC/CXE is authorized to develop and implement separate procedures for joint service management and
use of EOD TOs on CD-ROM/DVDs.
4.1.6.2 Content and Labeling. The CD/DVD must contain a content.txt ﬁle and may contain a readme.txt ﬁle (how to
use the CD/DVD), an Index ﬁle (to automatically direct users to the correct TO ﬁles), and if necessary, a copy of the viewing
software.
4.1.6.2.1 Content.txt File. The following information will be included in the required content.txt ﬁle:
• DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION: (TO Number)
• TITLE: TECHNICAL MANUAL SET: (Name)
• EDITION: (First, Second, etc.)
4-12

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_100
TO 00-5-3
• VOLUME IDENTIFIER: (DoD Activity Address Code (DODAAC) [6 characters] + TO Category [2 characters] +
Index Number [3 characters] (11 digits total)
• MAINTENANCE AND UPDATE FREQUENCY: (Update Period)
• ORIGINATOR COMMENTS: (Information on Formats, etc.)
• DOCUMENT ABSTRACT: (Purpose of CD/DVD)
• POINT OF CONTACT: (CD/DVD TOMA, Address, Email, and Phone Number)
• ORIGINATOR: (CD/DVD TCM, Address, Email, and Phone)
• TO POCs: (For each TO ﬁle included on the CD/DVD, list the TOMA and TCM Names, Organizations, Email
Addresses, and DSN Phone Numbers)
4.1.6.2.2 Readme.txt File (Optional). Use the same format for the content.txt ﬁle (above). The ﬁle may be included if
required to describe access to and use of viewer software, access to and use of any other programs on the disk (such as
ETIMS), and/or other helpful information not included in the content.txt ﬁle. If used, the readme.txt ﬁle should have a table
of contents to help the user identify and navigate to needed information.
4.1.6.2.3 CD-ROM/DVD and Case Labels. Labels (Figure 4-4 ) are formatted IAW MIL-STD-38784.
4.1.6.3 Digitally-Distributed TO File Sustainment. Only revisions will be used to update digitally distributed baseline
TO ﬁles. (See EXCEPTIONS Paragraph 4.1.4). Baseline TO ﬁles are the official, published (accessible to users) TO ﬁles
consisting of the basic digital TO ﬁle with any published change ﬁles merged (posted) into the baseline TO ﬁle. The use of
formal supplements for updating digital baseline TOs is discouraged and will be severely limited (see TO 00-5-1). TOPS
shall not be used.
4.1.6.3.1 Changes will only be produced when paper distribution is supported. The TO change will be merged with the
baseline TO ﬁle for digital distribution. The standalone TO change or revised TO ﬁle will be used to produce a master for
printing and distribution of paper.
4.1.6.3.2 For emergency and urgent updates, the TOMA or TCM will develop digital RACs whenever possible, instead of
an IOS or ISS (see TO 00-5-1). The digital RAC ﬁle will normally be merged with the baseline TO ﬁle, and the merged TO
and standalone RAC ﬁles will be accessed from ETIMS or program web site for distribution. ETIMS users will receive
automatic distribution of the merged ﬁle. The standalone RAC is distributed to allow local printing of the change for
updating paper copies of the TO.
4.1.7 Technical Order Update Package Processing. The responsible TOMA will:
4.1.7.1 Screen and Submit Update Packages. Screen all TO update packages to ensure required data is current and
complete, properly coordinated and includes all RCs speciﬁed for the next TO update. Submit approved packages to the
editorial function for publication of the TO update (specifying the update type), and distribute in the next routine update
cycle.
4.1.7.2 Record Copy. Ensure a copy of the published update is saved to the repository identiﬁed in the TOLCMP.
4.1.8 Technical Order Update Publication. Updates to individual TOs from all sources (AFTO Form 22, AF Form 847,
Mishap Investigations, Materiel Improvement Projects, etc.) will be consolidated for publication in periodic TO updates
(revisions, changes, or supplements). Periodic updates will not include modiﬁcation-related changes if this would delay
concurrent release with the prescribing TCTO. When faced with this situation, out of cycle updates may be necessary to
support the TCTO. Periodic intervals will be determined by the lead command, in conjunction with the PM, but should not
exceed 365 days. Periodic updates may be delayed beyond the normal update interval if no signiﬁcant inputs are received.
When TOs are grouped for publication, for example, a set of TO ﬁles published on a CD-ROM, it may be necessary to
4-13

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_101
TO 00-5-3
publish updates to the distribution media as frequently as monthly to accommodate varying TO publication release dates and
cycles. Thought should be given to synchronizing the publication cycle of the TOs included in the set and the distribution
media as much as possible to limit the number of media releases due to out-of-sync TO updates.
NOTE
Perform periodic reviews of change packages IAW Paragraph 4.1.4.7 if publication must be deferred.
4.1.8.1 General. The TOMA or TCM will aggregate all approved RCs submitted since the last TO update. The TOMA
determines if the updates will be developed organically or through contractor support.
4.1.8.2 Contractor Preparation. If a production contract is available for contractor preparation of TO updates, the
TOMA forwards a copy of AFTO Form 252 with all included documentation.
4.1.8.3 Organic Preparation. For organic update preparation, the TOMA forwards a copy of the AFTO Form 252 to the
editorial function for formatting as a change or revision.
4.1.8.4 Distribution Controls. See Paragraph 3.19
4.1.9 Evaluating Recommended Changes on Joint Service Technical Manuals.
4.1.9.1 Air Force-Managed Technical Manuals. Handle proposed changes to Joint Service TMs managed by the Air
Force (cognizant activity code F) IAW Paragraph 4.1.4.10.
4.1.9.2 TOMA Procedures for TMs Managed by Other DoD Components. The assigned Air Force TOMA handles
receipt and proposed changes to Joint Service managed by another DoD component the same as for an RC against an Air
Force TO. After evaluation for possible AF adoption, the RC is forwarded to the primary TM Manager for evaluation and
possible adoption for all TM users. Supersede any AF-only supplement if the managing component incorporates the change
in the TM.
4.1.9.3 TCM Procedures for TMs Managed by Other DoD Components. The Air Force TCM evaluates the recom-
mended TM improvement and determines required actions. If there is no assigned AF TCM, the TOMA will forward RCs to
the managing component for evaluation.
NOTE
Downgrading RC priority is not appropriate when the TM is the responsibility of another DoD component.
4.1.9.3.1 For AF-approved RCs, the TOMA or TCM issues an Air Force-only routine supplement IAW TO 00-5-1. The
TCM then routes an informational copy of the approved AFTO Form 22/AFTO Form 252 to the responsible DoD compo-
nent IAW AFI 20-118.
4.1.9.3.2 The TCM furnishes an information copy of disapproved AFTO Form 22 to OPR in the responsible DoD
component for possible implementation.
4.1.9.3.3 When an RC is placed in Abeyance or Advisement status, notiﬁcation of the responsible DoD component is not
required. Process the RCs IAW Paragraph 4.1.9.3.1 or Paragraph 4.1.9.3.2 after approval or disapproval. Do not refer
duplicate RCs to the other service. Do not use Deferred status for RCs against other service TMs.
4.1.10 Processing API Program Packages. An API program package is submitted and processed IAW AFI 38-402,
Airman Powered by Innovation (API) Program, and TO 00-5-1. The approved improvement-type AFTO 22 and resultant TO
change are included in the submittal in pursuit of the API cash award.
4.1.10.1 Stand-Alone Ideas. Stand-alone ideas which recommend a TO change will be disapproved for resubmittal on an
AFTO Form 22 (or AF Form 847). A stand-alone idea which does not recommend a TO change will be evaluated using the
Idea Program Data System (IPDS - https://ipds.randolph.af.mil), even if implementation causes a TO change. Retain all
documentation implementing approved changes, including any documentation used to calculate tangible or intangible sav-
ings, for two years IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule.

4.1.10.2 Conﬁrmatory Ideas. The Idea Analyst will automatically approve a Conﬁrmatory Idea based on an approved
Improvement-type RC, and base the award on AFI 38-402 and the information provided in the RC. Correction-type RCs are
not eligible to participate in the AF API Program.
4.1.10.3 Disputing Findings. If the initiator disputes the API program beneﬁts approved by the TCM, the RC must be

4.2 INTERIM TECHNICAL ORDERS (ITOS) AND RAPID ACTION CHANGE (RAC) PROCEDURES.
4.2.1 General.
NOTE
Programs issuing interim or formal Emergency and Urgent Operational and Safety Supplements or RACs which
could restrict any Air Force combat weapon system from full capability or operational readiness will provide
advance notiﬁcations IAW Paragraph 4.2.1.7.
4.2.1.1 Description. Interim Technical Orders (ITOs) are priority, electronically-distributed changes to TOs. Rapid Action
Changes (RAC) are priority, electronically-distributed changes used in place of ITOs to update TOs. When an interim
TO/TCTO update is indexed and distributed, TODOs with paper subscriptions will print the supplement portion of the WA-1
ﬁle and post to the front of their paper TOs as traditional pen and ink changes. ITOs and RACs are issued to resolve
deﬁciencies of an Emergency or Urgent nature (see TO 00-5-1). They may revise procedures, deactivate defective subsys-
tems or components, replace hazardous materials, restrict item use to known-safe areas of operation/ﬂight envelopes, or
remove systems/end items from service, depending on the nature and severity of the hazard.
4.2.1.2 Interim Safety Supplement (ISS). Issue ISSs when circumstances preclude timely publication of a formal TO
update. Issue Emergency ISSs and Urgent ISSs when safety conditions would result in a fatality or serious injury to
personnel, or when extensive damage or destruction of equipment or property is involved.
4.2.1.3 Interim Operational Supplement (IOS). Issue IOSs when circumstances preclude timely publication of a formal
TO update. Emergency IOSs are issued when the MAJCOM is unable to achieve or maintain operational posture (MISSION
ESSENTIAL) or there is a ﬁeld-level work stoppage. Urgent IOSs are issued for situations that reduce operational efficiency
or probability of mission accomplishment, provide replacements for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Hazardous
Materials (HAZMAT) and Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS), or could result in over $25,000 or 1,000 man-hours annual
savings to the Air Force.
4.2.1.4 Rapid Action Change (RAC). RACs are fully-formatted TO changes distributed electronically, used instead of
interim supplements as priority TO updates. RACs require the same coordination, advance notiﬁcation and approval as the
equivalent interim supplement.
4.2.1.5 Timelines. An IOS, ISS, or RAC must be issued within 48 hours after receipt of an emergency report (within 72
hours if report concerns work stoppage), or within 40 calendar days after receipt of an urgent report.
4.2.1.5.1 Emergency IOSs, ISSs and RAC notiﬁcations shall be sent to TODOs via an authorized, electronic dissemina-
tion method (Paragraph 5.5) and receipt acknowledged within two hours. If notiﬁcation is required on a weekend or holiday,
notify the affected units via the appropriate command post and record receipt acknowledgement. If the emergency supple-
ment or RAC will restrict any Air Force combat weapon system from full capability or operational readiness, provide
advance notiﬁcation per Paragraph 4.2.1.7. Emergency RACs are made available through an authorized, electronic dissemi-
nation method (Paragraph 5.5), and must be delivered to sub accounts and libraries within ﬁve hours of receipt by the
TODO.
4.2.1.5.2 Urgent IOS/ISS and RAC notiﬁcations shall be sent to TODOs via an authorized, electronic dissemination
method (Paragraph 5.5) and receipt acknowledged as soon as possible during duty hours. Urgent RACs are made available
through an authorized, electronic dissemination method (Paragraph 5.5), and must be delivered to subaccounts and libraries
within one duty day of receipt by the TODO.
4.2.1.6 Security Assistance Program (SAP)/Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Support. IOSs, ISSs, and ITCTOs are
issued to all FMS customer accounts on ID for the basic TO by the Security Assistance TO Program (SATOP). If CSTOs
have been developed; a separate IOS/ISS/ITCTO must be developed for each and issued to the FMS customer by the
4-15

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_103
TO 00-5-3
SATOP. TO Manager shall ensure all ITOs with subscription for parent TO in Security Assistance Technical Order Data
System (SATODS) are sent by encrypted email to SATODS workﬂow address (TinkerSatopInterim@us.af.mil) so the ITO
can be reviewed for release by the FDO prior to issue to the FMS customers.
4.2.1.7 Advance Notiﬁcation. The program office issuing formal or interim operational or safety supplements or RACs
shall provide advance notiﬁcation when the supplement or RAC would restrict any Air Force combat weapon system from
full capability or operational readiness (Reference TO 00-5-15).
• Notify senior AFMC and USAF leaders via the Advance Notice of Emergency/Urgent ISS, IOS or RAC Release
the ITCTO Advance Notiﬁcation System SharePoint Site (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/ANS/Pages/
Form at
ANSHome.aspx).
• See TO 00-5-15 for complete advance notiﬁcation requirements and additional ITO/RAC distribution addresses.
4.2.2 Procedures. Refer to the Flowchart, Figure 4-5. ITOs and RACs are usually prepared by the TCM for the basic TO.
ITO preparation may be delegated to an overﬂow contractor or the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Once an
emergency or urgent situation is identiﬁed, the responsible activity evaluates it for alternative courses of action. If hazards or
mission limitations cannot be resolved by a TO change, issue an IOS, ISS, or RAC as appropriate. If there must be an
inspection or a conﬁguration change to the system or equipment, issue an ITCTO (Refer to TO 00-5-15). ITOs and RACs
applicable to TOs distributed digitally must be in the same digital format as the TO itself. RACs must be merged with the
TO ﬁle, and ITOs must be attached to the ﬁle and digitally linked to the affected TO paragraphs.
4.2.2.1 Developing Interim Supplements.
4.2.2.1.1 Obtain the appropriate TO numbers from the TOMA. Research and develop the revised TO instructions, verify
and coordinate them IAW this TO. Prepare a replacement interim or formal update if a previously published ITO must be
changed before it is incorporated (RACs are incorporated upon issue).
4.2.2.1.2 Replace an ISS with a TO change or revision within 40 days of ISS release. Include IOSs/RACs in the next
routine update. EXCEPTION: ISSs and IOSs issued to provide temporary instructions (for example, restrictions to operat-
ing parameters pending completion of a TCTO, use of prototype equipment for ﬂight test, etc.) may remain active until
completion of the task or project or for 30 months, whichever is shorter. For revisions, supplements shall be incorporated or
reissued. Timelines for Interim Safety Supplements pertaining to ﬂight manuals can be found in AFI 11-215.
4.2.2.2 Creating Rapid Action Changes (RAC). A RAC is a TO update loosely formatted as a TO Change and distrib-
uted electronically like an ITO/ITCTO. RACs will be formatted as closely as possible to the manuals they update, and will
include a new title page and List of Effective Pages (LEP), as well as unchanged backing pages for each change page
included. It is prepared using desktop publishing or word processing software and saved in a format compatible with the
baseline TO ﬁle. RACs will be identiﬁed using the next sequential TO change number.
4.2.2.2.1 The TCM will develop the RAC content; the TCM, TOMA or editor will prepare (format) the RAC and create
a merged RAC/basic digital baseline TO ﬁle for distribution to TODOs. The following steps are involved in creating a RAC:
4.2.2.2.2 The TCM, TOMA or editorial/production activity responsible for formatting the change obtains the digital
baseline TO pages affected by the RAC (including title, LEP, data pages and corresponding backing pages), and converts
them (if required) into a changeable digital format.
4.2.2.2.3 Make necessary changes to affected pages IAW the approved RC. Title page and LEP format may vary slightly
from the current speciﬁcation or parent TO ﬁle format (e.g., column alignment, font size, dot leaders, graphic lines, etc.).
The title page notice must identify the change as an EMERGENCY or URGENT RAC.
4.2.2.2.4 The TCM and TOMA review and approve the RAC.
4.2.2.2.5 Convert the RAC ﬁle to PDF or other Page Description Language (PDL) software to convert RAC ﬁles to an
insert ﬁle compatible with baseline TO ﬁles.
4.2.2.2.6 Merging and Publishing RACs. The TCM, TOMA or editor electronically merges the PDF RAC ﬁle with the
PDF baseline TO ﬁle to create a new baseline TO, and re-links (indexes) the new ﬁle. The PDF RAC ﬁle shall also be
included as attachment to merged PDF. Merged ﬁle with RAC attachment shall be uploaded to ETIMS (Paragraph 5.5.1), to
4-16

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_104
TO 00-5-3
replace the previous version, thereby providing access to the complete TO and RAC. Merge and upload non-PDF TO ﬁles in
whatever ﬁle format was used to distribute the baseline TO ﬁle.
4.2.2.3 Approval and Release. Approval and release levels are listed in Table 4-2. The TO Management or FMM
divisions shall be the only PM functions allowed to release approved ITOs.
4.2.2.4 Indexing. The TOMA will index ITOs and RACs in ETIMS, marking it as local print (which will set the interim
indicator ﬂag to yes), prior to release. Send notiﬁcation of release through ETIMS with instructions for TODO on how to
obtain. RACs will be listed as regular changes.
4.2.3 ITO/RAC Notiﬁcation and Distribution.
4.2.3.1 Notiﬁcation Messages. When an ITO/RAC is issued, the TOMA or FMM responsible for the TO will notify
affected TODO accounts using the ETIMS notiﬁcation process that the ITO/RAC is available and how to obtain it. The
ETIMS notiﬁcation message will be sent within established timelines for Emergency or Urgent changes. ITO/RAC notiﬁ-
cations will contain:
• Affected TO number and title
• RAC number and date
• File names and sizes of the merged TO (if applicable) and RAC ﬁles (sizes are required to ensure users have
enough hard drive space to accomplish the download)
• Messages must include a point of contact and phone number to call in case of any technical problems.
4.2.3.2 Distribution. TODOs with paper subscriptions will print the supplement portion or RAC attachment of the WA-1
ﬁle. If TO does not have a WA-1 media type, any method of electronic distribution described in Paragraph 5.5 may be used.
NOTE
• Restricted TO ﬁles must be password protected and encrypted (AFI 33-115), and loaded on an access-con-
trolled (domain or user name and password) https site.
• RACs for distribution statement A TOs may be hosted on public web sites.
4.3 TECHNICAL ORDER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES USING ETIMS.
The TOMA makes changes to management data about a TO using the appropriate ETIMS screens when the correction,
addition, or deletion of TO management data elements is required. Use the screen completion procedures described in the
applicable FUG on the TOMA SharePoint site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531). The following paragraphs provide a vari-
ety of tasks that TOMAs must use ETIMS to perform.
4.3.1 Equipment Data Related to Technical Order Acquisition. The TOMA uses the Maintain Equipment List screens
to input or update Weapon Systems, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes and item part numbers (Refer to
FUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).
4.3.2 Establishing Sponsor Approval. Sponsor Approval is required on all TOs for which initial subscription and
distribution requests must be justiﬁed, reviewed and approved prior to issue. Sponsor Approval is automatically set by
ETIMS when conditions of Table 4-3 exist. The TOMA, in conjunction with the TCM, will determine the need to screen
distribution of other unclassiﬁed TOs.
4.3.3 Processing ID Subscriptions Requiring Sponsor Approval. Screen and approve new ID subscriptions when the
TO is ﬂagged for Sponsor Approval in the Review Sponsor Approval Request screen in ETIMS. Obtain concurrence of the
TCM before approving the subscription. Approval/Disapproval shall be completed within 10 calendar days of submittal by
TODO. (See FUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).
4.3.3.1 Proprietary data may be automatically approved for release to F*xxxx TO Accounts, but may only be released to
a contractor account owning the proprietary rights.
4-17

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_105
TO 00-5-3
4.3.3.2 For export controlled TOs refer to TO 00-5-19.
4.3.3.3 TODO personnel are required to delete all paper media ID requirements outside TO 00-5-3, Paragraph 5.4.3
exceptions, or submit justiﬁcation to the AF CTOM/MAJCOM representative for reconsideration. The TOMA is required to
send an ETIMS notiﬁcation to the TODOs 30 days prior to rescinding paper media. If paper media is still required, the
TOMA shall then make the paper Sponsor Approval. The TODO must provide their AF CTOM/MAJCOM representative
justiﬁcation to continue receiving paper TOs (see https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12837/default.aspx). Approved forms will be
coordinated with the TOMA. TOMA’s may send subsequent 30-day paper media rescission notiﬁcation annually.
4.3.3.4 If paper TOs have FMS customers on ID, the TOMA will not mark the TO as sponsor approval. The TOMA shall
email the Security Assistance Technical Order Program (SATOP) office (AFLCMC.EZGTC.Workﬂow@us.af.mil) with the
information and SATOP will contact the FMS customer within 30 days. If the TOMA does not receive a response from
SATOP within 30 days, the TO will be marked as sponsor approval only. Once SATOP receives a reply, they will contact the
TOMA. If paper copies are still required by FMS customers, the TOMA shall continue to provide TO paper copies.
4.3.4 Processing Requisition Transactions Requiring Sponsor Approval. TOMAs will receive notiﬁcation of One-
Time Requisitions (OTR) needing sponsor approval through their ETIMS home page. Approval of OTR sponsor approval is
completed in TODPG (See FUG https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).The TOMA will obtain concurrence of the TCM before
approving the subscription/requisition. Approval/disapproval shall be completed within 10 calendar days of submittal by
TODO. Justiﬁcation is not required for accounts already on subscription for the TO.
NOTE
Subsequent requisitions after an account has approved subscription will not require sponsor approval unless order
quantity is in excess of the Maximum Issue Quantity (MIQ).
4.3.5 Manage ETIMS Index. The TOMA uses the ETIMS Manage TOs screens, FUG and help screens proce-
dures, (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531) for changing TO Publication Type, TO Title, Pub Status, Sponsor Approval, Pro-
gram Group/Name, Lead Command and management data. These screens are also used to add and index TO basics, changes,
revisions, and supplements, and to mark rescinded, superseded, renumbered and ‘FMS only’ for increments, and to enter TO
conﬁguration and management information for the TO/TO increments.
4.3.5.1 Correct TO Conﬁguration and Management Information Errors. ETIMS users report errors in the accuracy or
quality of ETIMS TO Catalog data using ETIMS DDRs. TOMAs must verify and correct ETIMS Catalog TO record errors
within 7 calendar days after receiving notiﬁcation of the error. All ETIMS users will correct errors in the data they are
authorized to modify, or will contact the responsible data owner to make corrections.
4.3.5.2 Correct Printing and Distribution Errors. Users can also report errors in the accuracy or quality of printing,
reproduction and distribution of received TOs through the ETIMS DDR process. All TOMAs who receive issues from users
with TODPG problems, printing, reproduction or distribution requirements, etc., that cannot be resolved locally, will report
the issues by submitting a ticket to the Field Support Center, which will be directed to their TODPG Site POC. The TODPG
POC reviews the ticket and forwards to AF TOFST. If an issue reported to the AF TOFST results in the need for a ticket to
be created in the DLA Help System (DASH), then the AF TOFST will create the ticket. The AF TOFST will track the ticket
in the Field Support Center and DASH systems through ﬁnal resolution and notiﬁcation back to the TODPG POC. Any
TOMA/User that does not have a TODPG POC, will submit the issue directly to the AF TOFST.
4.3.6 Establish Shipping Priorities. Direct commercial printers to use classiﬁed mailing procedures (DoDM 5200.01, Vol
1) when distributing classiﬁed TOs. Direct use of ﬁrst-class mail for all emergency requisitions and for ID shipments of TOs
and TCTOs to APO/FPO destinations. When using the DLA Data Management Services TODPG for Initial Distribution
(ID), local DLA Data Management Services facilities will distribute copies to subscribers in their service areas. FMS
distribution will be handled by AFLCMC/LZPTC-TINKER.
4.3.7 Establish Maximum Issue Quantities (MIQ). Establish MIQs at a level that will be issued to a TODO without
additional justiﬁcation.
4.3.8 TCTO Rescission Review. TOMAs will use the ETIMS TCTO Rescission Report to generate a listing of assigned
TCTOs approaching rescission dates and provide the listing to the TCM. For those within 150 days of rescission, the TCM
will evaluate whether to extend the rescission dates or to rescind the TOs early or on the speciﬁed dates. TOMA will then
update ETIMS with a new rescission date or rescind the TCTO.
4-18

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_106
TO 00-5-3
4.3.9 Reports. ETIMS users can access numerous reports to assist with TO and TODO (TM) account management. These
reports are available from the ‘Manage TOs’ screen, such as Requisition Report, TO Number Request Report, Sponsor
Approval Report, Master Address Report, TO Catalog Report, etc. Procedures for accessing the reports are in the ETIMS
help screens and appropriate FUGs.
4.3.10 Establishing TODO (TO) Accounts. TODO accounts are established in ETIMS following successful processing
of AFTO Form 43 IAW TO 00-5-1.
4.3.11 Renumbering Technical Orders. The TOMA shall only request TO renumbering to correct serious numbering
errors caused by erroneous or insufficient source data before the TO is published and distributed. Published TOs will only be
renumbered when the assigned number prevents effective location or use of the TO, or the scope or range of the functionality
covered by the TO changes signiﬁcantly. TOs will not be renumbered to align with local sequence numbers or similar cross
reference identiﬁers. The responsible TOMA will request renumbering actions be accomplished through local TO Site
Functional office or AF TOFST (for locations without local TO Site Functional office). When renumbering a published TO,
both the new and former TO numbers will appear in the upper right corner of the title page with the former number preceded
by the word Formerly. Both numbers will remain on the title page until the next revision, at which time only the new number
will appear. Only the new TO number will appear on the individual updated pages. Unchanged pages will continue to
indicate the old TO number until they are changed for a reason other than simply renumbering, or until the next TO revision.
Distribution media suffixes are not included as part of the TO number for the TO itself.
4.3.11.1 When AFLCMC/LZPTP-TINKER approves a new number for unpublished TOs, the TO record is updated and
subscriptions submitted against the original number are automatically changed to the new one.
4.3.11.2 When published TOs are renumbered, ETIMS will automatically convert all past revisions and changes to the
new number.
4.3.11.3 eTOs distributed from sites other than the ETIMS repository are indicated by a WA-2 media suffix, with the host
site URL identiﬁed in the ETIMS TO details page in the WA-2 Repository/System Name Block. The WA-2 numbering is not
to be used for PDF eTOs. PDF’s should be WA-1 and distributed via ETIMS. An AFMC/A4F waiver is required for the use
of the -WA-2 suffix, except for the IETMs nuclear weapon TOs (11N), ICBM TOs, and classiﬁed TOs. A WA-2 waiver is
also required if a WA-1 suffix version is being distributed via the ETIMS repository and a second media version is to be
distributed via a non-ETIMS repository (e.g., an html version for depot operations, distributed from a prime contractor site).
4.3.11.4 The TOMA will number TOs IAW TO 00-5-18, and index and manage digital media IAW this TO. The only
procedural difference in numbering and indexing between the types of media is the suffix used to indicate media type. Media
suffixes will only be used when indexing and subscribing to the digital versions of the TO, they will NOT appear on the TO
title page.
NOTE
Even though the data on a CD/DVD is digital in
its format, it is considered physical media.
4.3.12 TCTO Series Numbering. TCTO series header numbers are assigned IAW TOs 00-5-15 and 00-5-18. TOMAs
will request a TCTO Series Header using the ETIMS Request TO number screen for an aircraft, missile or engine category
when a new TO series is established. (Refer to 00-5-15) TOMAs will request new TCTO series headers for other TO
categories when the ﬁrst TCTO is in preparation. A separate TCTO series header must be established when individual
TCTOs in the series will be assigned different classiﬁcations. Once a TCTO series header number is approved, ETIMS will
automatically number individual TCTOs in the series.
4.4 INDEXING TOS BY MEDIA TYPES.
4.4.1 Media Type Deﬁnitions.
4.4.1.1 Physical Media: Paper and CD-ROM/DVD.
4.4.1.2 Digital Media: Online Electronic TOs (eTOs -WA-1& -WA-2, IETM/S1000D based TOs).
4-19

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_107
TO 00-5-3
4.4.1.3 The minimum acceptable digital format for Air Force TOs is Adobe® Portable Document Format (PDF). When
TOs will be distributed in two or more distribution media, each media version must be separately indexed in ETIMS. Each
distributed media version will have its own TO Number consisting of the approved TO number plus the appropriate
distribution media suffix code. (Refer to TO 00-5-18.) Each TO number indexed will be assigned a corresponding Publica-
tion Stock Number (PSN) as speciﬁed in TO 00-5-18, and paragraphs below.
NOTE
TO Numbers assigned to CD-ROM or DVD disks used for the distribution of single or multiple digital TOs shall
reﬂect the TO number including the media suffix on the disk and case labels. (Figure 4-4.)
4.4.2 Paper TOs. The paper version of a TO must be marked FMS Only in ETIMS if there are FMS subscribers, even if
the US TODOs only subscribe to the eTO version. Consult the spreadsheet on the AFLCMC/LZPTC SharePoint: https://
org2.eis.af.mil/sites/21763/AFLCMCLZP/Tinker/LZPT/LZPTC/default.aspx to determine if there are FMS subscribers. When
only FMS subscribers to a TO remain, set the TO status to FMS Only.
4.4.3 CD-ROMs/DVDs. If a single TO or multiple TOs will be distributed on a CD-ROM or DVD, the TOMA must
establish a speciﬁc TO Number for the CD ROM or DVD distributed. These actions will ensure that users will be able to
subscribe to the CD-ROM/DVD TO or collection of TOs.
4.4.3.1
requests CD/DVD number and supersede the paper TO.
If a single TO distributed on CD/DVD will replace a single paper version (no paper distribution at all), the TOMA
4.4.3.2 For a collection of TOs that are to be distributed on CD/DVD, TOMAs will add TO collection to CD/DVD on
Manage TO Detail screen in ETIMS. (See FUG https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531). If the CD/DVD distribution will be for an
IETM/S1000D based TO, a Catalog Note will be included listing the TO groups contained on the CD/DVD (IETM/S1000D)
and indicate the viewing application or system required. The TO Number printed on the CD will be the same as the TO
Index. Individual TOs contained in the collection that are not available for distribution separately as paper shall be indexed
as -WA-1, if available through ETIMS. TO Manager shall associate all TOs in collection on CD/DVD Manager Tech Order
Detail page.
4.4.3.3 If TOs for multiple systems or commodities are included on the CD/DVD, use a disk TO number which will help
identify all of the systems/commodities. (See the instructions for establishing a TCTO Series Header Number in TO 00-5-
18.)
4.4.3.4 If multiple TO types are included (e.g., a disk containing operations, maintenance and inspection TOs), either use
the lowest TO type dash (-) number contained on the disk or omit the TO type designator altogether in the CD/DVD TO
number.
4.4.3.5 Numbering Multiple Disks in a Set. If a TO is published in volumes or a TO set is too large for a single disk, the
’n’ will indicate the volume/disk number. If a TO Set has varying classiﬁcations, or a supplemental TO has been published,
the ’n’ can differentiate between differently classiﬁed disks. See examples, TO 00-5-18.
4.4.3.6 TO Distribution Media Suffix Codes. Media suffixes will only be used when indexing and subscribing to
versions of the TO, they will NOT appear on the TO title page. TO Numbers assigned to CD-ROM or DVD disks used for
the distribution of single or multiple digital TOs shall reﬂect the TO number including the media suffix on the disk and case
labels (Paragraph 4.1.6.2).
4.4.4 eTOs. Digital TOs distributed electronically for use are known as eTOs. The distribution of eTOs is critically
dependent upon the capability to publish updates in a timeframe that meets interim TO (ITO) requirements. An eTO
numbering request will be given a standard TO number to include a -WA-1 suffix on the end of an existing or new TO
number in the ETIMS Catalog. Non-ETIMS eTOs will be numbered ending in the -WA-2 suffix (waiver required except for
IETM/S1000D based TOs, Nuclear Weapon Center TOs and classiﬁed TOs). The TOMA will create a new index record in
ETIMS. These actions will ensure that users will be able to subscribe to the eTO and that one-time requisition for the eTO
will not be processed. See FUG on TOMA SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531 for detailed guidance and
procedures.

TO 00-5-3
4.4.4.1 If the eTO will immediately replace the paper (i.e., no paper distribution at all), then the TOMA will request a new
WA-1 TO number for the digital version, and supersede the paper version. This will allow for a complete history of the paper
TO, as well as a complete and continuing history for the digital eTO.
NOTE
• The AF TOFST numbers, indexes, optimizes and uploads MAJCOM supplements to those MPTOs distributed
exclusively in pdf eTO format (Refer to TO 00-5-1). AF TOFST acts as a TOMA and TCM in ETIMS for
indexing purposes. TODOs are responsible for establishing subscription to the merged eTOs.
• Do not replace paper version with an eTO version of an Active Air Force TO with FMS Subscribers. Query ID
Requirement Report by logging into SATODS and viewing the ID Requirement Report or go to the SATOP
SharePoint
https://org2.eis.af.mil/sites/21763/AFLCMCLZP/Tinker/LZPT/LZPTC/
LZPTC%20Public%20Access%20Files/Forms/AllItems.aspx to view the ’All ID TO Requirement Report’ to
determine if there are any FMS Subscribers. If there are FMS subscribers, do not supersede the paper with the
eTO and do not rescind the paper version. Set the paper to FMS Only. Both paper and WA media will need to
be updated concurrently.
site
at
4.4.4.2 TOMAs must manually mark eTO index records in ETIMS as Available for Published Index. Once the eTO is
uploaded, validated and deployed using ETIMS processes, ETIMS will then mark the eTO available for distribution and
distributed to authorized Master eTools for viewing. eTOs shall not be uploaded or deployed prior to the eTO publication
date.
4.4.4.3 The AF TOFST has developed TOMA checklists to assist with ETIMS standard TO/eTO indexing, eTO mass
indexing, and WA-2 and WA-1 conversion. Use of the checklists is CRITICAL for successful accomplishment of TOMA
duties. Checklists are posted on the Air Force Technical Order Managers SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
NOTE
All digital ﬁle media (-WA-n), are indexed as revisions with a publication date matching the latest paper TO
increment (Revision, Change, or Supplement). The entire index history for the paper version should not be
duplicated for the eTO version.
4.4.5 Numbering and Indexing Supplemental TO Manuals and Parent TOs. When a Supplemental Manual (see TO
00-5-1) is published as a child to a parent TO, both publications must have a supplement notice on the title pages when one
cannot be used without the other. Use statement INCOMPLETE WITHOUT TO XX-XX-XX. The same statement will also
be placed in the ETIMS Catalog Notes for both TOs.
4.4.6 Distributing Marked-up Changes during System Modiﬁcations. TOMAs issue a waiver, with the written agree-
ment of the lead commands and MAJCOMs, to use veriﬁed preliminary changes (red-line, marked-up, or clean copies) for
required modiﬁcation programs such as data used to support maintenance on a TCTO-modiﬁed system until the related TO
changes are formally published. Authorized use of red-lined or marked-up TOs shall not exceed 180 days unless Lead
Command authorization is updated. The authorization memorandum must accompany the data at all times.
4.4.6.1 For electronic distribution, the TOMA will transmit as identiﬁed in the Lead Command authorization letter and
IAW Paragraph 5.5.
4.4.6.2 For physical media distribution, the TOMA will arrange for distribution of limited quantities as described in the
Lead Command authorization letter and IAW AFI 63-101/20-101, this TO and TO 00-5-1. Procedures to manage and control
preliminary changes will rest with the local using organization.
4.4.7 Interim TOs (ITOs). Index ITOs using a PSN with media code P (Printed Copy). Interim TOs cannot be requisi-
tioned and must be locally printed. TOMA will send notiﬁcation using ETIMS when ITO is deployed with instruction to
download.
4.4.8 Preliminary Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs). ETIMS will provide TCTO numbers and data codes
for new TCTOs based on the TCTO Header number.

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_109
TO 00-5-3
4.4.9 Numbering and Indexing Digital TCTOs (eTCTOs). Prior to distributing TCTOs, an eTCTO series header record
must be established in ETIMS. If eTCTOs are to be distributed using ETIMS, the eTCTO/eTCTO supplement will be
indexed using the WA-1 media suffix code and PSNs ending with 11. Non-ETIMS eTCTOs will use the -WA-2 media suffix
code. eTCTOs will be numbered as eTCTO Series-WA-1+ speciﬁc TCTO number (-501 or higher).
NOTE
• Care must be exercised to correctly sequence the ﬁrst eTCTO number assigned for the new eTCTO series, if a
matching physical media version of the TCTO already exists (see Paragraph 3.9.3.1). For example, if the latest
paper TCTO ended with 513, establish a corresponding WA-1 eTCTO series header record and index the ﬁrst
eTCTO as eTCTO Series -WA-1-514. This will require an additional renumber action in ETIMS to change the
ETIMS generated eTCTO Series-WA-1-501 to eTCTO Series-WA-1-514.
•
If paper TCTOs continue to be issued in parallel, both must be indexed, i.e., TCTO Series -514 (paper) and
eTCTO Series-WA-1-514. If paper TCTO ﬁles are distributed on CD/DVD, number and index the TCTO as
TCTO Series-CD (or DV)-1-501 (or higher).
4.4.10 Supplements. The TOMA indexes a new TO supplement by using the ETIMS Manager Tech Order Detail screen
and selecting the Add Supp in the Actions column. Supplement sequence numbers are assigned automatically in ETIMS and
restart at 1 (or C depending on type of supplement) after each TO revision. The new supplement is then distributed IAW TO
00-5-1 and this TO. (Refer to FUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).
4.4.10.1 If a supplement is indexed incorrectly (not as a revision), an FSC ticket will be required to delete the incorrect
increment and the TOMA will then index the revision.
4.4.10.2 FMP Supplements. FMP supplements have sequential supplement numbering for the life of the manual. ETIMS
will continue the numbering process on FMP Supplements with any new revision.
4.4.11 Supplements Affecting Digital TOs.
4.4.11.1 Publication of formal TO supplements is incompatible with a digital-only TO publication and distribution pro-
cess, and they shall not be used for HTML eTOs. However, if the publication of a formal TO Supplement is required to
support paper distribution of a TO, number and index the stand-alone supplement as a paper document (TO Number + S-n
or SS-n with a PSN ending in 06). The formal supplements for PDF eTOs or CD-ROM/DVD TOs will be merged into the
digital TO ﬁle prior to issue. The TO media (-WA-1, -CD-1, or -DV-1) will be indexed as a Revision with a PSN ending in
11, and will be dated the same as the paper supplement. Do NOT index an eTO supplement as a stand-alone ﬁle with
the -WA-1 media distribution code, as this will prevent loading either ﬁle to the ETIMS repository.
4.4.11.2 Paper interim supplements will be indexed in ETIMS by selecting Local Print, which ETIMS will automatically
select the interim indicator and assign a PSN ending in P (Printed Copy, used for messages which have to be printed locally).
Interim supplements to digital PDF eTOs will be merged into (posted to) the digital eTO prior to uploading to ETIMS. Refer
to TOMA SharePoint site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531) for speciﬁc details. The merged TO ﬁle will be indexed as a
Revision with a PSN ending in 11, with a publication date that matches the paper supplement date. HTML eTOs must use
RACs instead of interim supplements.
4.4.12 Interim eTCTO Supplements. Supplements must be merged into digital PDF TO ﬁles and posted IAW TO 00-5-1
and fully linked and annotated by the TOMA before uploading to ETIMS for viewing and distribution. This includes a title
page note referencing the supplement as well as hyperlinks to affected paragraphs. Refer to the FUG on the TOMA
SharePoint site (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531) for speciﬁc details.
4.5 TECHNICAL ORDER RESCISSIONS.
Rescind TOs when all media types will be deleted without replacement. Rescind single media type of TO only if FMS/SAP
is not on subscription in SATODS. Rescind TCTOs/eTCTOs when rescission dates are reached IAW TO 00-5-15, or the
TCTOs/eTCTOs are no longer required. Extend rescission dates on TCTOs/eTCTOs when required IAW TO 00-5-15.
4-22

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_110
TO 00-5-3
Rescind TCTO/eTCTO series headers when all media types of TO series are deleted. Perform digital repository ﬁle main-
tenance as necessary. For rescission of supplements to digital data, see Paragraph 4.1.4.2.3.2.
NOTE
TOs and increments replaced by or combined into new TOs and TO updates will be superseded not rescinded.
4.5.1 TCM Procedures. The TCM will perform the following actions before recommending rescission of a TO without
replacement, whether the need for rescission is identiﬁed through ﬁeld inputs or through a periodic post-publication review.
Rescind TCTO IAW TO 00-5-15.
4.5.1.1 Notify the TOMA of any proposed TO rescission of digital/paper/or both with the following information as a
minimum: TO number, known operational systems, commodities and related TOs involved, part number, type/model and
series of items, associated weapon system (and active/retired status), and also include any replacing data.
4.5.1.2 If provided by the TOMA, evaluate subscriber’s justiﬁcation to retain the TO. As required, contact subscribers
requesting retention for additional information or clariﬁcation. Advise TOMA to retain or rescind the TO.
4.5.1.3 Ensure the system or commodities affected have been removed from operation and phased out of the inventory by
checking the Standard Reporting Designator (SRD) through REMIS.
4.5.2 TOMA Procedures.
4.5.3 The TOMA will perform the following actions prior to rescission of a TO without replacement.
4.5.3.1 Use the ETIMS Notify Subscribers Screen to advise all affected users and managers (TODOs, PMs, FMS (SATOP
Office), etc.) of the proposed rescission. If the TO is joint-service, follow AFI 20-118 procedures to notify other DoD
activities. Include all of the information provided by the TCM in the notiﬁcation message. Request detailed justiﬁcation be
provided by any subscriber who opposes the rescission. Include a pending rescission date in the notiﬁcation (not less than 30
days from the notiﬁcation date).
4.5.3.2 If upon the pending rescission date, no subscribers have provided justiﬁcation to retain the TO, the TOMA will use
the ETIMS Manage TO screen to rescind the TO and update the ETIMS Catalog. The TO record remains in ETIMS.
4.5.3.3 If detailed justiﬁcation to retain the TO is received, provide the justiﬁcation and subscriber’s contact information
to the TCM for evaluation/resolution.
4.5.4 Rescission of Supplements on Digital (-WA-1) only TOs. ETIMS requires a newer date to deploy eTO so the
following will be required:
4.5.4.1 Remove supplement and current annotations from PDF and annotate on Title Page S-X rescinded DDMMMYY.
4.5.4.2 Upload PDF to ETIMS with rescission date of supplement.
4.5.4.3 Index revision in ETIMS where pub date is rescission date of supplement and add catalog note stated S-X
rescinded DDMMMYY.
4.5.5 Rescission of Single Media Type. This procedure is accomplished when only one media type requires rescission
for USAF but is used by FMS/SAP. Prior to the rescission of one media, it must be determined if the TO is used by
FMS/SAP. If the TO is used for FMS/SAP, set TO status in ETIMS to FMS Only.
4.5.6 Nuclear Weapons TOs. Send rescission requests for nuclear TOs to the AFNWC/NCL Technical Support Flight,
2000 Wyoming Blvd SE, Kirtland AFB NM, 87117-5617.
4.5.7 Joint Service to Retention. If joint-service-use TOs are still required by another service, transfer TO management,
reproduction masters, and warehouse stocks to that service. (See AFI 20-118).

TO 00-5-3
4.6 TECHNICAL ORDER SUPERSEDURES.
4.6.1 Deﬁnition. Superseded TOs and TO increments are deﬁned as increments being replaced by a revision or a new
increment in the same TO series, or when replaced by or incorporated into another TO in a different series. Supersede
TCTOs when replaced by a new TCTO.
NOTE
Add a Catalog Note in ETIMS, to the record of any superseded TO that is replaced by a different TO, use the
statement: Replaced by TO XXX-XXX-XX. Add a matching Catalog Note to the replacement TO record, use the
statement: Formerly TO XXX-XXX-XX or Includes TOs XXX-XXX-XX.
4.6.2 Supersedure Notices. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the supersedure notices shall be placed on the title page when
the manual/change/revision/RAC under preparation supersedes all or portions of other manuals/changes/revisions. When
speciﬁed, the supersedure notice shall include a list of all currently superseded supplements and RACs IAW MIL-STD-
38784. No supersedure notice is required when PTOs are superseded. Provide any special instructions in the change package
(e.g., the list of TO increments to be listed in the title page supersedure notice).
Examples:
• When an SH252 is being incorporated
into a new increment, the SH252 Project
Number and date must be listed on the
title page supersedure notice of the new
increment. Example: THIS PUBLICA-
TION SUPERSEDES SPECIAL HAN-
DLING AFTO FORM 252 PROJECT
NO. 51Mxxxxxxxxxxxx, DATED 20
JULY 2011.
• When an IOS/ISS is being incorporated
into a change, the IOS must be listed on
the title page supersedure notice of the
new increment. Example: THIS PUBLI-
CATION SUPERSEDES TO 00-5-3S-1,
DATED 12 FEBRUARY 2010.
4.6.3 TO Disposition. The TOMA will supersede or rescind TOs when they have been replaced or are no longer required,
IAW this TO. TOs will be retained in the Archives until six years after the equipment supported leaves the inventory
(reference Paragraph 5.7, Archive Procedures).
4.7 REACTIVATE TECHNICAL ORDERS.
TOMA changes TO status from rescinded to active using the Manager Tech Order Detail screens IAW the ETIMS
FUG (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).
4.8 TRANSFER OF TECHNICAL ORDER MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY.
4.8.1 Business Practices. Responsibility for TO program and content management transfers to the new ETIMS propo-
nent if the system or equipment covered by the TOs is transferred. Both losing and gaining proponents must agree on the
transfer and schedules before any actions can occur. Transfer should include all TOs and all TO family increments in the
affected TO series; i.e., all related basics, changes, supplements, source data, TCTOs and TCTO series headers. TOMA and
TCM responsibilities must also be transferred within the proponent when the assigned personnel transfer or otherwise
become inactive.
4-24

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_112
TO 00-5-3
4.8.2 Transfer Agreements. If gaining proponent does not agree with the transfer, the applicable TO Site Functional
Office has the authority to intercede and assist with the transfer. This can only be accomplished once research of all legacy
systems indicate the TOs belong to the gaining organization. If proponent transfer is still a dispute, AFMC/A4F will make
the ﬁnal determination.
NOTE
4.8.3 Proponent Transfer Procedures. The losing TOMA will identify to the gaining TOMA, TOs to be transferred on
a spreadsheet (template located at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531). The gaining TOMA completes spreadsheet with propo-
nent, TO Manager and Equipment Specialist for each TO on spreadsheet. Spreadsheet is provided to local TO Site Func-
tional Office or AF TOFST (for location with no local site office), who will, in turn, create and submit a Field Support Center
ticket.
4.8.4 Print Ownership Transfer in TODPG. When transfer of TO management responsibilities occur and there are TOs
residing in TODPG for printing, the losing and gaining TOMAs have actions to complete. See FUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/
sites/10531 for instructions.

CHAPTER 5
TECHNICAL ORDER REPRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
5.1 TECHNICAL ORDER DISTRIBUTE AND PRINT GATEWAY (TODPG).
TODPG is the AF-directed system used for all printing of physical media TOs (paper, CD/DVD).
5.1.1 TODPG Concept of Operation. TODPG provides the central DLA Data Management Services repository with
ready- for-production (print ready) PDF format TO ﬁles in support of physical media Initial Distribution (ID) and subsequent
One-Time Requisition (OTR) transactions for complete TOs or for speciﬁc (active) TO Changes and/or Supplements.
TODPG is the central point in a DLA Wide Area Network (WAN) connecting DLA Data Management Services production
sites. TODPG sends ID/OTR print orders through the DLA network for reproduction, packing and shipment by DLA
Document Services sites closest to the TODO customer-worldwide.
5.1.1.1 All ID transactions are processed by an interface between ETIMS and TODPG. Once a new physical media
increment is made available for index in the ETIMS catalog, jobs are already created in TODPG for Technical Order
Managers/Agents (TOMAs) to upload content. Once content is loaded, ETIMS is notiﬁed through interface and label
information is sent automatically to TODPG to support ID print and distribution.
5.1.1.2 All OTR transactions are processed by an interface between ETIMS and TODPG. ETIMS TODO-approved OTR
transactions are sent directly to TODPG where it is determined if the requisitioned TO has been uploaded to TODPG. If the
TO has been uploaded and the correct version of the requisitioned TO is available, TODPG will deliver the print job to the
DLA Data Management Services site closest to the TODO for printing and direct shipment. If the TO has not been uploaded
to TODPG, or a current version of the requisitioned TO is not uploaded, it will be placed in a held status until it is correctly
uploaded into TODPG for processing.
5.1.1.3 The following statement is required on the title page of merged master ﬁles for ALL TOs when incorporating
previous increments: BASIC AND ALL UPDATES HAVE BEEN MERGED TO MAKE THIS A COMPLETE PUBLICA-
TION. The merged master ﬁle will consist of the basic TO and all active changes and supplements. For reprints and OTR
support, the master ﬁle is required to be uploaded to TODPG. For digital eTOs, see Paragraph 5.4.5.1.
5.1.1.4 Depending on proﬁle settings, TODPG provides Job Status email notiﬁcations.
5.1.1.5 When USAF TOs are totally distributed as eTOs through ETIMS and there are still FMS paper printing distribu-
tion requirements, funding changes are required to the TODPG system to support the uploading of the digital ﬁle in support
of the FMS printing requirement. See Functional Users Guide (FUG) at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531 for instructions.
5.1.1.6 An interface between the Security Assistance TO Data System (SATODS) and TODPG will manage the printing
and distribution of AF TOs directly to responsible freight forwarders when FMS customers are on subscription for Air Force
TOs uploaded on TODPG.
5.1.1.7 Security Assistance Technical Order Program (SATOP) has assumed distribution responsibility of AF TOs to
authorized FMS accounts.
5.1.2 Funding for Sustainment of TOs and TODPG Operations. TO Managers must identify printing, packing and
shipping costs. TO sustainment funding requirements will be documented via the Comprehensive Air Force Technical Order
Plan (CAFTOP), TO Information Sheet (TOIS) and Centralized Asset Management (CAM) processes.
5.1.2.1 TO Managers must establish fund cites in TODPG for reimbursement of funds to DLA Data Management Services
for the printing, packing and shipping costs as applicable on all ID, OTRs and complete merged set uploads.
5.1.2.2 TODPG provides the capability to enter more than one fund cite per weapon system program, i.e., TODPG will
support separate fund cites required for sustainment reproduction, modiﬁcation production, TO packing and shipment.
TODPG also allows the user to annotate a split percentage from a fund cite for a speciﬁc job. Example: A percentage from
a sustainment fund cite and a percentage from a modiﬁcation fund cite may be used for any single job to total 100% funding.

5.1.3 Establishing TODPG Account. The TOMA or their designees will access TODPG to accomplish the following:
5.1.3.1 The ﬁrst action must be to establish a TODPG User Proﬁle (See FUG https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531).
5.1.3.2 Initial TODPG training for users will be accomplished by contacting the local TO Site Functional Office TODPG
POC. Also, TODPG Functional User Guides are located on the Air Force Technical Order Managers SharePoint site at
https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
5.1.4 Requirements for TODPG Operations.
5.1.4.1 Loading ID Increments. The TOMA or designee will prepare the digital TO ID print and merged packages.
TOMA will submit by accessing TODPG and completing the ordering processes for job(s) created when Available for Index
was set to Yes in ETIMS. For detailed instructions, refer to the FUG on the Air Force Technical Order Managers SharePoint
site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. Table 5-1 identiﬁes jobs requiring completion based on ID print job.

5.1.4.1.1 The user must upload a PDF master reproduction TO ﬁle (paper distribution) or Master CD/DVD ﬁles. For step
by step procedures for uploading PDF ﬁles, access the TODPG Functional User Guides located on the Air Force Technical
Order Management SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
5.1.4.1.2 A Reproduction Assembly, AFTO Form 30, Reproduction Assembly Sheet, is not required but can be uploaded
into TODPG when the TOMA has determined it necessary to specify printing instructions. Special printing requirements (i.e.
foldouts, color pages, bleed border, etc.), will be shipped at the end of the TO and may require collating during TO posting.
5.1.4.1.3 Indiscriminate marking of jobs as emergency/urgent causes delays in true emergency/urgent processing as well
as routine processing. Use of Emergency and Urgent submission of ID jobs will be limited to following cases:
• Emergency print requests support TO requirements that WOULD result in a fatality or serious injury to personnel,
extensive damage or destruction of equipment or property and must be processed within 48 to 72 hours.
• Urgent print requests support TO requirements that COULD cause one or more of the following: personnel injury,
damage to equipment or property, reduce operation efficiency and/or jeopardize the safety or success of mission
accomplishment. Urgent must be published and distributed within 40 calendar days.
NOTE
Both the ID and merged jobs have to be at content loaded status in TODPG before ETIMS will set the Available
for Distribution ﬂags to yes and generate ID labels.
5.1.4.2 Mandatory Uploads of Complete Merged TOs & TCTOs. Once a single TO/TCTO has been made available
for index in ETIMS or an interim supplement has been distributed digitally, a merged copy of the TO must be uploaded to
TODPG.
5-2

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_126
TO 00-5-3
5.1.4.2.1 Complete, merged TOs consist of the basic TO with all TO changes merged, all supplements including active
formally distributed and interim supplements, which must be appended to the complete merged TO.
5.1.4.2.2 Complete, merged TCTOs consist of the basic TCTO and all supplements, including all active formally distrib-
uted and interim supplements which must be appended to the basic TCTO. Special instructions/procedures for upload of
merged TCTOs can be found on the TOMA SharePoint at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
5.1.4.3 Technical Order Page Supplements (TOPS). TOPS will NOT be used in TODPG (or ETIMS). If the AF TO
contain TOPS, the TOPS must be incorporated into the basic TO as either a change or formal supplement before loading into
TODPG (or ETIMS).
5.1.4.4 The TOMA has several controls that may be used with the DLA Data Management Services process: 1) request
proof copies (for ID printing only); 2) require funds approval before printing (for both ID and OTR); and 3) establish
ETIMS Sponsor Approval for the TO to limit requisitions.
5.1.5 TODPG Help Desk Procedure. When a user experiences problems with TODPG, printing or distribution require-
ments, etc., the user will notify the local Site Functional Office TODPG POC providing full details of the issue. The Site
Functional TODPG POC will generate an incident ticket in the TODPG help system and will track and monitor until
resolution has been reached.
5.1.6 TOMAs Management of TODPG Transactions. Proof and funding approvals shall be processed within 7 days of
assignment. Sponsor approvals shall be screened and processed within 10 days. Emergency requisitions shall be screened
and processed within 2 work days. Emergency requisitions can be processed by the TOMA as an emergency or as a normal
transaction based on adequacy of justiﬁcation provided.
5.1.7 Manage TODPG Held Transactions. All One-Time Requisitions (OTRs) will ﬂow from ETIMS to TODPG. Held
transactions are OTRs from ETIMS that cannot process due to a metadata mismatch or the TO not being loaded to TODPG
and TOMA will be notiﬁed by email of a held transaction or information can be found in the TODPG held report. The held
transactions shall be rectiﬁed within 7 days.
5.1.8 Concurrent Release of Physical TO Distribution Media. When paper TO distribution media is required to
support the concurrent release of Flight Manuals, TO updates, and TCTOs, the FMM/TO Manager must document their
concurrent release requirement on a spreadsheet. This enables the DLA Home Site to determine if the requirements can be
satisﬁed at the DLA Home Site and allows the ordering of additional supplies, if required. This spreadsheet shall be provided
to DLA 30 days prior to the job being submitted. If projected submittal date is delayed, FMM/TO Manager shall notify DLA
of new projected submittal date. If the order has not been submitted by projected submittal date and DLA is not notiﬁed of
delay, DLA is permitted to use the supplies for other jobs. If this happens, FMM/TO Manager may experience delay in
completion of concurrent release if additional supplies are required when job is submitted. Spreadsheet format and the
complete concurrent release process can be found in the TOMA FUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
5.1.9 Reprinting Department of the Army (DA) Publications. When the Army TM manager cannot provide additional
backup stock of joint-use DA publications, the affected TOMA may have to reprint copies for AF use. When DA publication
masters are not available, a printed copy of the publication is sent to DLA Data Management Services for reproduction.
Requests for printing and the reproduction assembly sheet will include the following instructions:
• The DA publication number is printed on the title page only. The Air Force TO number is printed on the title page
(below the DA TM number) and all other pages of the reprint.
• Replace the heavy DA paper cover with a standard Air Force title and A page. Do not reﬂect changes separately on
the A page since the reprint is considered a merged basic.
• Enlarge text and illustrations, if possible, to ﬁll the normal printing area of the standard Air Force page size.
• Use standard Air Force TO binding, drilling, stapling, etc.

TO 00-5-3
5.2 TECHNICAL ORDER REPRODUCTION (NON-ETIMS).
TOMAs must arrange for the reproduction and distribution of any PTO or TO that is not managed in ETIMS. DLA Data
Management Services manages all TO printing and reproduction requirements for the Air Force IAW DoDI 5330.03,
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services.
5.3 TECHNICAL ORDER DISTRIBUTION PRACTICES.
5.3.1 Preliminary TOs (PTOs). PTOs are distributed by a contractor or other developing activity to support IPRs,
veriﬁcation, and prepublication reviews IAW the tables in Section 2 of the TMCR. Distribution is limited to the acquisition/
review participants. Distribution of PTOs for Test and Evaluation (T&E) or operational use is controlled by the TOMA IAW
AFI 63-101/20-101. PTOs are not distributed via ETIMS for viewing.
5.3.2 Operational Use PTOs. Using organizations may use preliminary data for hands-on training, operations, or main-
tenance when veriﬁed and authorized by the PM or representative along with concurrence from the Lead Command or
Depot. Authorization for the use of preliminary data shall not exceed 180 days unless readdressed. The authorization
memorandum must accompany the data at all times. The TOMA will arrange for printing, storage and distribution of PTOs
approved for use in the operational environment IAW this TO. For major acquisition or modiﬁcation programs, the prime
contract may cover PTO storage and issue. Each page of the PTO will contain a watermark stating that the PTO is not for
ﬁeld use.
5.3.3 Formal TOs. Formal paper and CD-ROM/DVD TOs are distributed IAW TO 00-5-1 and Paragraph 5.5. Formal
eTOs are distributed via ETIMS (Paragraph 5.5.1) unless program has an AFMC/A4 approved waiver.
5.3.4 Restrictions. Distribution of both formal and preliminary TOs may be restricted to government agencies, govern-
ment contractors, or as otherwise speciﬁed by the TOMA and TCM (Chapter 3).
5.3.5 TO Shipments. All package service or USPS shipments shall use tear-resistant, secure envelopes for TO packages
weighing less than ﬁve pounds. TOs boxed for shipment will be secured using strapping tape or bands.
5.3.6 Manage Outside Agency Requests for Air Force TOs. Process requisitions from other U.S. government agen-
cies, contractors and civilians IAW TO 00-5-1 and AFI 20-118. Process Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for TO
data strictly IAW DoDM 5400.07, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, DODD 5230.25, Withholding of Unclassiﬁed
Technical Data From Public Disclosure, this TO and TO 00-5-1.
5.3.6.1 TOs with Distribution Limitation codes B through F may be exempt from release under FOIA, IAW DoDD
5230.25, DoDM 5400.07, and AFI 61-201 .
5.3.6.2 Requests for TOs from activities or individuals outside the limitations speciﬁed by the assigned Distribution
Statement must be approved by the DoD Controlling Office (responsible TOMA and TCM). If the responsible office cannot
be identiﬁed, refer requests for TO release to HQ AFMC/A4F, email: afmc.a4.af.topp@us.af.mil, to determine the proper
release authority.
5.3.6.3 If the TO or other technical data is not marked, it will be handled as STINFO Distribution Statement F, and will be
referred to the responsible TCM for assignment of an appropriate Distribution Statement prior to being issued.
5.4 PUBLISHING ELECTRONIC TECHNICAL ORDERS.
5.4.1 Ensure Conﬁguration Control of Multi-Media TOs. When TOs are published in more than one medium (e.g.,
paper and WA-1), information about the conﬁguration of the TO (TO Catalog data) and all media formats must reﬂect the
same content conﬁguration. The digital online (-WA-1) version, after optimization, shall be uploaded to ETIMS, and de-
ployed when other media types are submitted to TODPG for reproduction. This ensures eTOs are deployed at same time or
before other media. EXCEPTION: Flight manual and/or checklist distribution of electronic media type may not be concur-
rent with the paper media type. See AFI 11-215 for further guidance.
5.4.2 Transition to Electronic TOs. The AF CTOM/MAJCOM representative responsible for coordinating transition to
digital only distribution shall assess eTool deployment status at their operational locations to ensure effective eTool programs
are in place. When the MAJCOM operational locations have effective eTool programs, they will notify their TODOs to
remove paper ID. The TOMA will send an ETIMS notiﬁcation (or email) to the TODOs 30 days prior to rescinding a paper
5-4

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_128
TO 00-5-3
TO, requesting a response from the TODO. If no response is received, the paper TO will be rescinded after 30 days. When
a paper TO has been rescinded, the TODO receives a notiﬁcation via ETIMS. TOMAs shall not remove TODO IDs. If paper
is still required, the TOMA shall then make the paper Sponsor Approval. The TODO must notify their MAJCOMs and have
their AF CTOM/MAJCOM representative provide justiﬁcation to continue receiving paper TOs. Refer to Paragraph 4.3.3.
When paper ID requirements no longer exist, the TOMA shall rescind the paper version for Air Force use or make FMS
Only in ETIMS if there are FMS customers. Verify FMS/SAP users prior to rescission of paper TOs.
5.4.2.1 The TOMA will
and contact SATOP (AFLCMC/
EZGTC.Workﬂow@us.af.mil) for TOs 30 days prior to rescinding a paper TO. When no FMS ID exists, the TOMA will
make the paper Sponsor Approval for new ID requirements. When FMS requires paper distribution the TOMA will not mark
sponsor approval (Paragraph 4.3.3).
send an ETIMS notiﬁcation to the TODOs
5.4.2.2 The USAF TODOs must provide their AF CTOM/MAJCOM representative justiﬁcation to continue receiving
paper TOs. The form required for justiﬁcation can be found at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12837/default.aspx. SATOP office
must receive paper retention justiﬁcation email from FMS customers within 30 days of TOMA rescission notiﬁcation.
5.4.2.3 The AF CTOM/MAJCOM representative or SATOPS representative will send all approvals to the TODO and
TOMA. The TOMA will continue to provide the TODO with paper TO media.
5.4.2.4 The TOMA and SATOP may remove paper ID subscriptions from TODOs that do not provide justiﬁcation within
30 days.
5.4.3 Paper Distribution Justiﬁcations. A justiﬁcation is not required when distributing paper for the following reasons:
• Flight Manual Program TOs exempted from digital distribution and use by AFI 11–215.
• TOs which must be taken into and removed from highly restricted areas. (Ref AFI 21–101, Paragraph
1.19.10; 1.19.11)
• Active AF TOs used by FMS customers who require paper copies.
• TOs which are 100% foldout wiring diagrams or schematics or the contained wiring diagrams or schematics
are unusable electronically in the intended workplace.
• AFNWC managed TOs in the 11N Indices
• Any other circumstances must be approved by AF CTOM Representative/MAJCOM based on justiﬁcation
requests submitted using the justiﬁcation format.
5.4.4 Preparing an eTO for Distribution. The TOMA must index the required increment and mark Available for Index,
upload, validate and deploy an optimized eTO using the ETIMS program. For speciﬁc procedures, refer to the FUG on the
TOMA SharePoint https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
5.4.5 Publishing eTO Updates. The eTO version of a TO also available in paper is published by issuing the TO ﬁle with
all changes and supplements merged into a single document ﬁle. See Technical Order Supplement Merging Process at
https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. If unable to access this https site, send an email to: af.etimstofst@us.af.mil.
NOTE
The use of formal or interim supplements is
strictly forbidden in HTML eTOs.
5.4.5.1 The title page of an eTO version will be identical to the paper version (i.e., it will indicate the same basic date and
show the latest change and change date). Supplements will be merged (posted) to the TO ﬁle IAW TO 00-5-1, annotated and
linked from the title page and each affected paragraph. The digital TO version will have a merged statement: BASIC AND
ALL UPDATES HAVE BEEN MERGED TO MAKE THIS A COMPLETE PUBLICATION.
5-5

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_129
TO 00-5-3
5.4.5.2 WA-1 eTOs. WA-1 eTOs are indexed as revisions with a publication date matching the latest paper TO increment.
The updated, merged electronic TO ﬁle content will retain the appearance and layout of the paper TO to include changes,
supplements (interim or formal) or Rapid Action Changes (RACs) as appropriate.
NOTE
Publishing processes for digital-only TOs must be capable of producing complete TO updates (revisions) as
quickly as an Interim TO supplement could be produced for a paper version. Managing TO supplements is
incompatible with digital publication and distribution processes.
5.4.5.3 WA-2 eTOs. WA-2 eTOs are eTO versions not accessible through ETIMS. TO Details page will indicate the
location of the complete eTO ﬁle. These eTO updates are often published using proprietary publishing capability. TOMAs
must take steps to ensure only current and complete eTOs are available for viewing or distribution. NOTE: A waiver is
required to distributed WA-2 eTOs outside of ETIMS. See Paragraph 4.3.11.3.
5.4.6 CD/DVD Media. CD/DVD media will only be used as a distribution method in situations when ETIMS cannot
provide electronic TO distribution. Once electronic distribution can be provided, the CD/DVD will be rescinded using the
same process as paper in Paragraph 5.4.2.
5.4.6.1 CD-ROM/DVD Contents. The TOMA for the CD-ROM/DVD is responsible for CD-ROM/DVD format, num-
bering, labeling, publication, packaging and distribution. The content of TOs on a CD-ROM/DVD must be identical to that
of the individual (stand-alone) paper TOs. The TCM for the CD/DVD, in coordination with the TOMA and MAJCOM, is
responsible for determining which TO ﬁles will be included on the CD/DVD (Paragraph 4.1.6.1). Classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed
TOs will not be mixed on a single CD. The TOMA will determine routine update intervals, in conjunction with the Lead
Command, and the TCMs of the TOs included on the CD/DVD.
5.4.6.2 Grouping TOs on CD/DVD Media. Groupings shall be made logically (e.g., by TO category, series, sub-system,
subject, distribution limitation, classiﬁcation, etc.) by the TCM, with the concurrence of the Using/Lead Command. The
TCM must revise the CD or DVD whenever any TOs on the disk are updated, and must re-associate the included TOs with
the CD/DVD TO number.
5.5 ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION OF TECHNICAL ORDERS.
The below paragraphs outline the authorized methods and procedures for disseminating Controlled Unclassiﬁed Information
(CUI), applicable for any technical data (including Technical Orders, Technical Reports, Test Data, etc.) with STINFO
distribution statements B through F. Reference publications include DoDI 5230.24 and DoDD 5230.25; AFI 63-101, AFI
17–130, Cybersecurity Program Management, Air Force Systems Security Instruction (AFSSI) 8520, Identiﬁcation and
Authentication, and AFI 61-201.
NOTE
The AF TO Field Support Team (AF TOFST) has developed TOMA Checklists to assist with ETIMS standard
TO/eTO indexing, eTO mass indexing, and WA-2 and WA-1 conversion. Use of the checklists is CRITICAL for
successful accomplishment of TOMAs duties. Checklists are posted on the Air Force Technical Order Manager
SharePoint site at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531. TOMA Checklists are under Document Management.
5.5.1 Distribution Using ETIMS (eTOs). ETIMS is the official method for distribution of Air Force eTOs; use of any
other method on a program-wide basis will require a written, WA-2 waiver IAW Paragraph 4.3.11.3.
5.5.1.1 TOMAs access GCSS-AF eTO Services’ eTO Repository to upload eTOs and updates for electronic distribution.
TOMAs and their support organizations will need stylesheets, ArborText Editor and CPS software to transform SGML-
tagged TO ﬁles to HTML eTOs for publishing on the ETIMS Repository. When uploading PDF eTO ﬁles, ﬁlenames shall
consist of the paper TO number with a .PDF extension (e.g., eTO 00-5-3-WA-1 would be 00-5-3 .PDF). This ﬁlename
remains static during subsequent update by the TOMA in support of external linking to eTOs within and outside of their
management control. Do not confuse the static ﬁlename for the .PDF ﬁle with the .CAB ﬁlename which is created by the
5-6

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_130
TO 00-5-3
CPS software and should not be changed. Once the eTO update is uploaded, validated and marked Available for Index, the
TOMA can deploy through the ETIMS Manage Technical Order screen. Once deployed, the eTO will be distributed to
Master eTools and made available to view online in ETIMS.
NOTE
Failure to comply with the standard, static eTO ﬁlename convention renders external links to eTOs inoperative.
This forces TODO personnel and TO users to adopt labor-intensive workarounds to accomplish the mission.
5.5.1.2 The GCSS-AF framework suggests a ﬁle-size limitation on ETIMS of 128 MB for loading eTO ﬁles, due to the
excessive amount of time required to download the ﬁle to the ETOV. If any eTO ﬁles are larger than 128 MB that are to be
loaded into ETIMS, it is highly recommended to section the TO into two or more volumes. TOs may be broken out by
chapters or other logical divisions as necessary, and each volume must have its own title page, TO number, LEP and Table
of Contents; title pages must have this statement: This TO is not complete without TO ###; and the volumes must be indexed
in ETIMS as-WA-1 for upload to ETIMS. This requirement is in addition to the rules for multivolume manuals in MIL-
STD-38784. See TO 00-5-18 for numbering rules.
NOTE
TOMAs will ensure their authoring entity optimize TO ﬁles by using the fast web view Adobe function prior to
upload into the ETIMS repository. The same optimized version of the ﬁle will be used for printing.
5.5.1.3 Other eTO Distribution Systems. Consult local procedures for uploading eTOs (non-AF HTML or PDF ﬁles
with a -WA-2 suffix) to other repositories for eTO viewing and distribution operations. Access or distribution of eTOs
available or hosted by systems other than ETIMS is dependent upon each system’s design for access or distribution. TODOs
with subscriptions for these eTOs must independently establish access to these systems.
5.5.2 PDF eTOs with Paper Distribution. If a PDF version of a TO will be distributed both in paper and electronically,
the same .PDF ﬁle will be used to support both methods.
5.5.2.1 A copy of the .PDF TO or TO update ﬁle will be indexed in ETIMS and uploaded to TODPG for printing paper
and Initial Distribution. Then the TO ﬁle and any update ﬁles will be merged to make a complete, current TO for follow-on
Print-On-Demand (POD) through TODPG.
5.5.2.2 For distribution as an eTO, the merged PDF TO ﬁle will be indexed as a revision having a -WA-n suffix and with
the same date as the latest update. It will then be uploaded to ETIMS for distribution and viewing.
5.5.2.3 Interim (Local Print) TOs are not uploaded to TODPG for distribution. ETIMS eTO will be used to support TODO
local print requirements.
5.5.3 HTML/XML eTOs with Paper Distribution. HTML/XML TOs can only be updated by revisions, changes or RACs.
Supplements cannot be used with HTML/XML format. If paper is required, the same source SGML ﬁle that created the
HTML/XML TO is used to create Adobe PDF ﬁle for TODPG printing and ID. After ID is complete, the PDF TO ﬁle and
any PDF update ﬁles will be merged into a complete current TO for follow-on OTRs. The HTML TO ﬁle is updated with all
changes and regenerated from the source SGML. The transformed ﬁles can be viewed using the AF eTO Viewer in ETIMS
or eTools.
NOTE
Distribution of ITOs using email shall be limited to instances where no ETIMS version of eTO exists. A notiﬁ-
cation shall be sent using ETIMS to ensure all subscribed TODOs are aware of emailed TOs.
5.5.4 Distribution Using Email. There are two levels of email available to most TO system users:
• Medium Grade Service using Microsoft Outlook and a CAC on the NIPRNet to digitally sign and encrypt Con-
trolled Unclassiﬁed Information (CUI), restricted distribution messages, and a SIPRNet Account for transmitting
classiﬁed messages.
• Unsigned, unencrypted Outlook (or other Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) programs) for publicly releasable
messages (distribution statement A).
5-7

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_131
TO 00-5-3
5.5.4.1 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Email (Microsoft Office Outlook) with CAC. This method can be used
to send signed and encrypted CUI on the NIPRNet. Classiﬁed information must be sent over the Secure Internet Protocol
Router Network (SIPRNet) which requires username and password access. Both sender and recipients must have their CAC
certiﬁcates properly registered in order to sign and encrypt/decrypt messages. Refer to the Setting Up and Using PKI for End
Users training page on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) web site at https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/html/. For Organizational
Accounts, (Paragraph 5.5.4.6).
NOTE
• There is an alternative practice for use by Certiﬁed U.S. Contractors not authorized CACs. They can request a
DoD-approved External Certiﬁcate Authorization (ECA) issued by Verisign, Digital Signatures Trust (DST), or
Operational Research Consultants (ORC). Refer to the ECA web site at http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/.
• Prime contractors and vendors may not have access to signed, encrypted email if they do not have .mil access,
nor will FMS customers have access. A copy of AF ITOs will be sent to TinkerSatopInterim@us.af.mil for
distribution by SATOP.
• Ensure all recipients on address lists are authorized access to the data being transmitted. Do not send CUI to
organization addresses which go to all or most of the organization. A TODO email address is authorized for
use. Reverify address lists as often as practical but at least annually.
5.5.4.2 Secure Distribution via Email. This policy applies to all methods used for email, including BlackBerry and other
handheld devices, Outlook Web Access, and remote email via Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) over secure hypertext transfer protocol.
NOTE
• For security reasons, unsigned, unencrypted Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email can only be used for
transmitting distribution A (public release) Interim TOs, RACs or ITCTOs. Any Outlook messages containing
restricted-distribution data (codes B-F) must be digitally signed and encrypted using a CAC or External Certi-
ﬁcation Authority (ECA) certiﬁcates.
• Personnel who do not have certiﬁcates published to the Global Address List (GAL) may have to exchange
emails to get their certiﬁcates recognized. Public key certiﬁcates for DoD personnel can be obtained at DoD
Global Directory Services (GDS) web site https://dod411.gds.disa.mil/ (.mil domain and CAC required).
5.5.4.3 Use the Sign and Encrypt icons in Outlook (envelope with a red seal and envelope with a lock superimposed), to
secure messages before they are sent. See the Help function in Outlook for more information. To ensure receipt by the
addressees, ask for an S/MIME Receipt (Outlook Tools/Options/Security).
NOTE
Recipients must have current, valid, registered CAC certiﬁcates.
5.5.4.4 Digitally Signing Emails. Digital signatures shall be used whenever it is necessary for the recipient to be assured
of the sender’s identity, have conﬁdence the email message has not been modiﬁed, or when non-repudiation is required.
Examples include formal direction to a government employee or contractor, messages that stipulate an Air Force official
position on any matter, and messages committing, authorizing or denying funding in some manner. Do not sign messages
containing only unofficial information and not containing an embedded hyperlink and/or attachment.
5.5.4.5 Encrypting Email. Emails shall be encrypted when they contain For Official Use Only (FOUO) information;
Privacy Act Information; Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII); individually identiﬁable health information, DoD payroll,
ﬁnance, logistics, personnel management, proprietary and foreign government information; contract data; export controlled
technical data or information; and operational information regarding status, readiness, location, or operational use of forces
or equipment. Encryption increases bandwidth and resource requirements; therefore, email encryption should be used to
protect only the above types of information, and the number of email recipients should be kept to a minimum. (This includes
technical data with STINFO codes B through F) DoD PKI-based encryption is not authorized for protection of classiﬁed
information on non-secure systems, such as the Non-classiﬁed Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET).
5.5.4.5.1 Each major AF installation has a service delivery point through which all email traffic (both in- and out-going)
is funneled. The link between SDPs (e.g., Wright-Patterson AFB to Hill AFB) is encrypted. Beyond the SDPs, there is no
5-8

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_132
TO 00-5-3
guarantee that data is encrypted. It is possible that data could be sent or received by a .mil user connecting through an
unprotected connection. Additionally, on base transmissions may not encrypt the data.
5.5.4.5.2 Verify receipt of controlled data by requesting a delivery receipt using the Outlook Options icon found in the
new or forwarded message window.
5.5.4.5.3 Regular SMTP Outlook Email: Use of regular, unencrypted email messages is only authorized for distribution
statement A (public release) data.
NOTE
Due to problems with distribution, especially to FMS/SAP customers, ITOs and other eTO updates may also be
distributed physically on paper or CD-ROM using address labels like paper TO distribution, to ensure all accounts
on subscription for the TO receive all authorized updates.
5.5.4.6 Exchanging Emails with TODO Organizational Accounts. US Government TODOs (i.e., F* accounts) are
required to associate an organizational email account with their TODO account. For TOs containing public releasable
content, TOMAs may augment ETIMS distribution (Paragraph 5.5.1) of urgent TO updates by exchanging emails with these
TODO accounts. For TOs containing controlled, unclassiﬁed content, TOMAs shall send notiﬁcation through ETIMS and
may augment with an email notiﬁcation to TODOs for urgent TO updates. TOMAs can upload the content to internet sites
with appropriate access controls.
5.5.5 Distribution Using the Internet.
5.5.5.1 Non-ETIMS Sites. Use of such sites instead of ETIMS requires a WA-2 waiver from AFMC/A4F IAW Paragraph
1.2.1, https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12837/default.aspx. TO listings on host servers will include the TO Number, Date, Title, and
Change Number/Date to allow users to verify conﬁguration of downloaded copies without opening or downloading the ﬁle.
Additional information, such as TOMA or TCM information, is optional. Ensure the host server has appropriate access
controls to protect limited distribution TOs and data (AFIs 33-115, 17–130).
5.5.5.2 AF SharePoint Folders. TOMAs may augment the dissemination of restricted distribution TOs via ETIMS
through the use of AF SharePoint folders. TOMAs create restricted TO folders and provide advance access while authorized
users set alerts to automatically receive an email when restricted TOs are uploaded. TOMAs shall follow the FUG proce-
dures at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531 to ensure SharePoint folders are clearly identiﬁed as restricted and access is limited
to subscribers previously authorized in ETIMS.
5.5.6 Other Distribution Methods. There are several other methods, both electronic and physical, for distributing con-
trolled, unclassiﬁed data.
5.5.6.1 Secure facsimile machines (fax) which encrypt the data for transmission may be used.
5.5.6.2 Physical distribution on physical media via USPS mail or U.S. package delivery service is authorized. The data
may be printed and mailed using the same delivery methods as physical media or paper TOs (references: AFI 16-1404, TOs
00-5-1, and 00-5-19.
5.5.6.3 In all cases, the sender must verify the address by checking the Master Address Report (MAD) in ETIMS and
ensure the recipient is authorized access to the data being sent. The authorizations must be reveriﬁed as often as practical but
at least annually.
5.6 ERRATA SHEETS.
TOs and TO increments distributed with missing or misprinted pages may be corrected by redistributing the missing/
reprinted pages using an Errata cover sheet and ETIMS Errata Process. Refer to FUG on https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531.
The Errata Cover Sheet (see Glossary) will provide instructions to insert/replace the pages into the affected TOs and how to
document receipt in ETIMS. The TOMA will also add a Note on the Errata Cover Sheet explaining the purpose of the errata
package.
5.6.1 SAP/FMS Customers for TOs in TODPG. SATOP will notify TODPG to re-accomplish requisition jobs using
correct Errata job.
5-9

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_133
TO 00-5-3
5.6.2 Errata Sheet Procedures for POD (TODPG) and ETIMS Distribution. Errata sheets may be processed for AF
POD (TODPG) TOs. If the problem requiring errata sheets is due to printing problems, DLA Data Management Services will
reprint and distribute the corrected TO or increment at their cost. If the problem is due to administrative errors or incomplete
reproducible PDF masters, the TOMA will provide an errata package to the TODPG and fund for its reproduction and
distribution. Prepare the errata package including cover sheet and pages for distribution as a PDF ﬁle. Refer to ETIMS Errata
FUG at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10531 for procedures.
5.7 OFFICIAL AIR FORCE TECHNICAL ORDER ARCHIVES.
5.7.1 Business Practices. One copy of every published TO and TCTO increment (Basic, revision, change and supple-
ment) must be preserved in an official Air Force TO Archive to comply with record retention provisions of the Federal
Records Act and to ensure preservation for Air Force needs. Archived ﬁles will only be the digital or printing source ﬁle
(.pdf).
5.7.2 TOs are held for 6 years after they are rescinded, contracts are closed and the supported equipment is dropped from
AF inventory (Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/, Table 33-40, Spe-
cialized Publications ; Rule 3, Technical Orders). Program offices will coordinate with their applicable TOMA to establish
a TO archive. All programs will document their archive processes within their TO Life Cycle Management Plan. See
EXCEPTIONS in Paragraph 5.7.2.8
5.7.2.1 The official archive for all Hill AFB TO management programs is the Comprehensive Integrated Technical Order
Management System (CITOMS).
5.7.2.2 The official archive for all Robins AFB TO management programs is the Centralized TO Repository (CTOR).
5.7.2.3 Programs utilizing IDM with content management may use the IDM environment as the archive.
5.7.2.4 The official classiﬁed digital archive is Robins Secure TO Repository (STOR).
5.7.2.5 All AF TOs in the 11N index will be officially archived by AFNWC.
5.7.2.6 Programs not currently using one of the above archive repositories will establish archive capability with Robins
AFB CTOR. Contact the Robins TO Site Functional Office for assistance. (Appendix B)
5.7.2.7 All requests for archival TOs will be performed IAW TO 00-5-1, para 3.4.
5.7.2.8 EXCEPTIONS: JNWPS TOs managed by AFNWC/NCL are archived by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency
(DTRA). DTRA also archives nuclear EOD TOs. See Chapter 7 for archive procedures for JNWPS TOs.
5.7.3 Tinker Archive is no longer required to maintain physical TOs; paper, CD, DVD, regardless of the TO status, i.e.,
active, rescinded, renumbered, or superseded. EXCEPTION: FMS-Only status TOs and TOs with FMS ID. All physical
media TOs will be dispositioned by TOMA offices accordingly, i.e., speciﬁed to destroy or retain. For election to retain TO,
shipping funds and manpower will be required; for election to destroy TO, TOMAs must ensure a digital copy is archived
per Paragraph 5.7.2.

CHAPTER 6
ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH
6.1 GENERAL.
Safety and environment hazard information and precautions must be included in TOs and technical data for operation,
maintenance, modiﬁcation and disposal of systems and commodities, IAW MIL-STD-38784. This includes MILSPEC TOs,
commercial manuals, AFMC Form 202 and AFTO Form 252, etc. TOs must identify any hazards that exist and must not
create hazardous situations. Everyone involved with the TO System must assist in evaluating, identifying, and correcting
safety and health hazards.
6.1.1 Safety Offices. The appropriate office should be involved from the start of TO development, beginning with the
TOP/RC. Safety will provide guidance on the placement, wording and application of warnings, IAW MIL-STD-38784.
6.1.2 Commercial Manuals. Commercial manuals may require supplementing to add warnings and cautions due to the
Air Force environment or application. Any conﬂict in the use or wording of warnings shall be resolved by HQ AFMC/SE.
6.2 TECHNICAL ORDER MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES.
The TOMA should establish points of contact with Engineering, Safety, Bio-environmental Engineering (or equivalent) and
Environmental Management (EM) offices to resolve Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health issues.
6.3 ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH (ESOH) REQUIREMENTS.
Engineers or ESs responsible for TO content will coordinate any new or revised procedures in non-exempt TOs (see Table
6-1 and Table 6-2) that might affect the environment and/or safety and health of personnel, cause damage or destruction of
equipment, or affect TO warnings or cautions, with the appropriate ESOH activities (e.g., Appropriate Safety, Bioenviron-
mental Engineering, and Environment Management).
6.3.1 Safety Review. Appropriate Safety offices must approve new or revised technical procedures affecting the safe
operation and maintenance of systems and equipment (AFI 91-202, USAF Mishap Prevention Program). This requirement
applies to Ground, Flight, Missile and Explosives safety for Nuclear Surety, see Paragraph 6.7.
6.3.2 Health Review. Appropriate Bio-Environment Engineering (BEE) offices must approve new and changed technical
procedures affecting personnel health (involving noise, heat, air contaminants, chemicals, radiation, lasers, thermal stresses,
biological and ergonomic hazards, etc.). The Appropriate BEE (or equivalent) offices may request consultative assistance
from: (1) U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine 711th Human Performance Wing (HPW) Occupational & Environ-
mental health Division (711 HPW/OEH), Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, (2) the
711th HPW/HPO - Human Systems Integration office, (DSN 798-2666), and/or (3) HQ AFMC/ SGPE - Command Bio-

Safety Offices, in conjunction with Bio-Environment Engineering (BEE), Fire Department and Environment Management
(EM) Offices, are tasked to periodically review design handbooks, TOs, MIL-PRFs, MIL-DTLs, MIL-STDs, and Table of
Allowances to ensure safety and health criteria and procedures (to include ﬁre safety and environment concerns) in those
6-2

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_136
TO 00-5-3
documents comply with Occupational Safety and Health guidance (AFI 91-202, USAF Mishap Prevention Program and AFI
91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction).
6.4.1 TO Safety Reviews. The acquisition agency System Safety or Ground Safety (SEG), BEE (or equivalent), Fire
Safety and Environmental Management (or equivalent) Offices are responsible for supporting TO reviews during the acqui-
sition process. When the acquisition agency is at Product Center coordination with the Air Logistics Complex counterparts is
essential. System Safety and/or SEG personnel are the SMEs for electrical, mechanical, chemical, radiation, and laser
hazards. BEE and EM personnel review TOs for personnel hazards and hazardous material (HAZMAT)/Ozone Depleting
Substance (ODS) usage and hazardous waste risk. The Fire Safety Office will review any procedures involving ﬁre protec-
tion matters such as exposure to heat and ﬁre.
6.4.2 TO Procedures. TO procedures shall be developed to protect equipment from abuse, inadvertent operation, or any
condition which could cause damage or degradation. However, the TO must not become a work-around for hazardous
equipment design.
6.4.3 Electrostatic Discharge Sensitive (ESDS) Devices. ESDS devices within most modern electronic equipment
require special protection and handling procedures. The guidance contained in TO 00-25-234, General Shop Practice
Requirements for the Repair, Maintenance and Test of Electrical Equipment, and MIL-STD-1686, Electrostatic Discharge
Control Program for Protection of Electrical and Electronic Parts, Assemblies and Equipment (Excluding Electrically
Initiated Explosive Devices), may be provided to the contractor as source data and references.
6.5 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RISK MANAGEMENT.
Managing HAZMAT risk and preventing pollution requires a proactive and dynamic management approach because preven-
tion achieves environment standards through source reduction rather than after-the-fact correction.
6.5.1 Reduced Use of HAZMAT and ODS. TO procedures shall be developed to reduce the use of hazardous materials
in all phases of weapon system development from concept through production, deployment and ultimate disposal. TCM must
ensure compliance with Air Force 32-70,
(Environment Quality) series instructions.
6.5.2 Establishing POCs. Points of contact should be established with engineering, safety, environmental management,
Appropriate BEE, and Research and Development (R&D) offices to address HAZMAT risks and resolve pollution prevention
requirements.
6.5.3 Waivers to Use Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS). If Class I ODS must be used, the PM must obtain a waiver
from HQ USAF for ODS use. By international agreement, all Class I ODS production effectively ended on 31 December
1995 and Class II ODS production shall incrementally decrease and cease by 2030. Dependence on Class II ODS usage
beyond the year 2015 will create potentially increasing risks to Air Force mission capability and costs. (AFI 32-7086,
Hazardous Materials Management).
6.6 WEAPON AND FLIGHT SAFETY.
Weapon and ﬂight safety programs are managed at several levels. Chapter 4 and Chapter 16 of AFI 91-202 list OPRs and
procedures for speciﬁc types of TOs. These OPRs will identify the appropriate safety offices. Flight Safety and three major
areas of weapon safety (explosive, nuclear and missile) must be addressed for any military system.
6.6.1 Flight Safety. Flight safety reviews for FMP TOs are the responsibility of the FMM. The TOMA is responsible for
ensuring contractor compliance with direction. Cargo aircraft loading manuals which deal with explosives or nuclear weap-
ons and weapon loading and delivery manuals must receive required explosive and/or nuclear safety reviews as well as ﬂight
safety reviews.
6.6.2 Explosive Safety Requirements. Basic TOs and all updates containing procedures on the operation, maintenance,
inspection, modiﬁcation, disposal, etc. of aircraft systems, ammunition, missiles (strategic or tactical), missile motors,
explosives, egress systems, armament items (such as guns, launchers, dispensers, pods, etc.), and handling, support or test
equipment peculiar to these items must receive a weapons safety review by the Appropriate Weapons Safety Office. All TO
procedures involving explosives must comply with AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards. EXCEPTIONS: The
GACP, AFLCMC/EBHMA, has safety review responsibility for TOs prime at Hill AFB. The Naval EOD Technology
Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) performs an internal explosives safety review on all Category 60 EOD TOs.

For AFLCMC/WWL and AFSC/424 SCMS 11N TOs, Paragraph 7.2.1 through Paragraph 7.10 apply.
7.2 NWC SURETY REQUIREMENTS.
7.2.1 Technical Evaluation. TO procedures involving nuclear weapons, nuclear combat or non-combat delivery systems,
or support equipment certiﬁed and approved for use with nuclear weapons (see Master Nuclear Certiﬁcation List, https://
wwwmil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/mncl/index.cfm) must receive a technical evaluation for nuclear surety (AFI 63-125, Nuclear
Certiﬁcation Program, and AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Certiﬁcation Program ). AFI 63-125 requires nuclear
certiﬁcation of TO procedures involved in a weapon system’s nuclear mission operations, maintenance, troubleshooting,
OPCERT, DECERT, nuclear compatibility, handling, movement, restraint conﬁguration, loading, unloading, delivery, and
testing. Nuclear Safety Certiﬁcation is required to ensure compliance with nuclear Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSR);
requirements in 91-100 series Safety AFIs, nuclear safety, and design safety features. The technical evaluation for nuclear
surety is a continuing process applicable to system or commodity operational usage changes, modiﬁcation procedural
changes, and changes to individual nuclear WSSRs.
7.2.2 Documentation and Marking. The TCMs and responsible engineers for nuclear weapon TOs will accomplish and
document technical evaluations on all change packages against assigned TOs. Mark applicable procedures in the TOs with
HCP or NSP (Hardness Critical Procedure or Nuclear Surety Procedure) as appropriate per MIL-STD-38784. Review safety
rules and record/review accomplishment as required by AFI 91-102, AFMC Sup, Nuclear Weapon System Safety Studies,
Operational Safety Reviews, and Safety Rules. Ensure TOs used with or in support of nuclear weapons specify use of nuclear
surety certiﬁed equipment only (AFI 91-103).
7.3 ACQUISITION/MODIFICATION PROCEDURES.
7.3.1 Nuclear technical orders are an integral part of the Nuclear Certiﬁcation Process. Certiﬁcation requirements must be
identiﬁed early to ensure the program is properly funded for TO development/changes and TO requirements do not nega-
tively impact the program’s overall schedule.
7.3.2 The PM will submit a Nuclear Certiﬁcation Impact Statement (NCIS) for a new acquisition or system modiﬁcation
as early as possible so the certiﬁcation process can begin. Include any impacts to nuclear weapon TOs in the NCIS (Refer to
AFI 63-125).
7.3.3 PMs must involve the applicable AFNWC, AFSC/424 SCMS and/or AFLCMC/WWZL TOMA from the beginning
of all acquisition or modiﬁcation programs affecting nuclear weapons/nuclear weapon systems.
7.3.4 AFNWC, AFSC/424 SCMS and/or AFLCMC/WWZL TOMAs must be involved in all TO Guidance Conferences,
In-Process Reviews, TO Veriﬁcation Planning Conferences, etc., when nuclear weapon TOs are affected.
7.4 NUMBERING.
The PM or Program TOMA will coordinate with AFNWC/NCLS TOMA for any new 11N TO numbers. For any non-11N

7.5 TODPG.
AFNWC/CC has not authorized distribution of nuclear TOs identiﬁed in TO 0-1-11N-1-CD-1 through a web based system.
Therefore those TOs will not be distributed through TODPG but will be distributed in physical media as identiﬁed in the
index. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) must authorize the use of any web based distribution for JNWPS TOs
and DTRA has not authorized the use of TODPG.
7.6 REQUISITIONS.
Requisitions for NWC TOs identiﬁed in TO 0-1-11N-1-CD-1 will be processed as identiﬁed in TO 00-5-1, Chapter 10.

7.7 REPOSITORY.
AF Nuclear TOs will be archived by the TOMA. Joint Nuclear Weapons Publications are archived by DTRA Albuquerque
NM Office (AO).
7.8 SECURITY ASSISTANCE TECHNICAL ORDER PROGRAM.
FMS related nuclear TOs, identiﬁed in TO 0-1-11N-1-CD-1, are not covered under TO 00-5-19, SATOP Program but are
managed by AFNWC through SAF/IA. These types of TOs should be identiﬁed during the NCIS process or early in the
Program planning.
7.9 ENVIRONMENTAL, SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH.
The Program Office will ensure ESOH is complied with by contractors or organic agencies providing source data through an
evaluation process or certiﬁcation letter from the provider of source data as requested by the TOMA/TCM.
7.10 TECHNICAL ORDER CHANGE PROCESSING.
Recommended changes must follow a manual process through encrypted email, secure SharePoint sites, or USPS mail.
There are currently no AFNWC managed IETM/S1000D based TOs.
7.10.1 Recommended Changes During Acquisition. Changes during acquisition must be worked closely with the
applicable AFNWC TOMA to assure Nuclear Certiﬁcation impacts are addressed. Early involvement in the TO acquisition
process will ensure changes can be addressed at the appropriate time and manner to prevent ﬁelding delays.
7.10.2 Recommended Changes During Sustainment. Changes will be processed through the submitter’s Product
Improvement Manager (PIM), the MAJCOM, who will submit it to the TOMA, or as directed by the TOMA, for processing.
7.10.3 Recommended Changes for JNWPS TOs. Joint Nuclear Weapons Publications recommended changes and
processes are managed as identiﬁed in TO 11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports (URs). URs are processed through DIAMONDS.
If you do not have access to a DIAMONDS terminal, contact AFNWC/NCLL workﬂow and they can help you process
recommended changes. AFNWC/NCLL is the Air Force JNWPS Executive Agent to provide the interface between DOE and
the Air Force for JNWPS TOs. It is important to note that JNWPS TOs do not follow the same criteria as AF TOs for
assigning Routine, Urgent, and Emergency deﬁciencies. (Reference TO 11N-5-1).
7.11 SOURCE DATA.
Contractors or Program Offices, if organically developed, will provide written certiﬁcation that all source data meets RGL,
bio-environmental, and general safety requirements previously identiﬁed in this TO and are ready to be added to the nuclear
operational technical orders, unless there is another process in place to validate those requirements. This will be part of the
source data package or PTOs when delivered to AFNWC for TO updates or veriﬁcation of PTOs. (Must meet Paragraph
3.9.5.1 Certiﬁcation Requirements).
7.11.1 Nuclear Weapons Delivery Source Data - Weapons Delivery Source Data Package (Aircraft -25, -30
Series Technical Orders).
7.11.1.1 Content. Weapons delivery source data consists of a section for nuclear data and sections of aircraft-speciﬁc data
for each aircraft that will employ the nuclear munitions. The content is described in MIL-DTL-38384, Manuals, Technical
- Aircraft Nonnuclear/Nuclear Weapon Delivery Procedures.
7.11.1.2 Development. Delivery envelopes for nuclear weapons are normally developed by the Air Force SEEK EAGLE
Office (AFSEO) in coordination with information provided by AFNWC and the Program Office (Reference AFI 63-104).
7.11.1.3 Procedures and Responsibilities. Nuclear procedures will be developed by the program office in coordination
with AFNWC/NC to ensure nuclear surety and safety is met.
7.11.1.3.1 Flight Manuals will be developed by the contractor or organic agency as described in MIL-DTL-38384 and are
part of the nuclear certiﬁcation process administered by AFNWC/NC.

7.11.1.3.2 The lead MAJCOM is responsible for providing a Flight Manual veriﬁcation team manager, a qualiﬁed aircrew
member, and in coordination with the Program Office all equipment to support the veriﬁcation effort.
7.11.1.3.3 The TOMA/FMM is responsible for conducting the veriﬁcation to formally verify the ﬂight manual procedures.
7.11.2 Nuclear Munitions Loading Source Data - Source Data Package (Aircraft-16 Series Technical Orders).
7.11.2.1 Requirements. A Source data package containing nuclear munitions loading source data is required during the
development and testing of new nuclear munitions items or systems, for integration of existing munitions with new aircraft,
for integration of new munitions with new aircraft, and for major modiﬁcations to existing aircraft/munitions conﬁgurations.
(Reference AFI 63-104 and AFI 63-125.)
7.11.2.2 Development. The source data package is maintained by the program acquisition TOMA and is used to update
the certiﬁed source data package. The source data package is maintained by the Program Office and is provided to aircraft
contractors/organic agencies for development of aircraft -16 series TOs and checklists. It is important to note when devel-
oping procedures to integrate conventional defensive weapons with nuclear weapons, the entire process must be evaluated as
a nuclear load. Nonnuclear conventional loading procedures may not meet nuclear surety and must be veriﬁed as part of the
nuclear certiﬁcation process when integrated. This is normally done using a nuclear/conventional integrated loading check-
list.
7.11.2.3 Nuclear Munitions Loading TOs. The -16 series TOs and checklists contain descriptive data and procedures for
loading nuclear munitions on or into Air Force aircraft. Participants: Source data package acquisition participants include the
TOMA, MAJCOM(s), aircraft PMs, AFNWC, the RTO, and AFSEO.
7.11.2.4 Procedures for New/Modiﬁed Munitions and Systems. The Program Office will submit an NCIS as outlined
in AFI 63-125.
7.11.2.4.1 For new/modiﬁed systems the TOMA/TCM will coordinate with the Program Office and lead MAJCOM to
develop a plan to identify source data requirements, veriﬁcation plan, and schedule to ﬁeld nuclear certiﬁed TOs.
7.11.2.4.2 Veriﬁcation is essential to the nuclear certiﬁcation process and will be in compliance with the TOMA or
ES/TCM life cycle veriﬁcation plan. (Must meet Paragraph 3.9.6.4, TO Life Cycle Veriﬁcation Plan Requirements.)
7.11.2.4.3 Veriﬁcation participants will include representatives from each aircraft PM involved, affected MAJCOMs, and
the OT&E manager.
7.11.2.4.4 The lead MAJCOM will provide the Veriﬁcation Team Manager (VTM) and a certiﬁed weapons load team as
requested by the TOMA/TCM.
7.11.2.4.5 The lead MAJCOM and/or PM, as applicable, will provide all necessary aircraft and support equipment for the
veriﬁcation effort.
7.11.2.4.6 All changes identiﬁed during the veriﬁcation effort will be done by the contractor or organic agency to meet
ﬁelding requirements.
7.11.3 Depot Level ICBM Operation and Maintenance Control Manuals. The following applies to ICBM Control
Manuals and associated Contractor Data Manuals (CDM), which consist of Utility Technical Manuals, D2s, Performance
Criteria Documents, test equipment instruction manuals, etc.
7.11.3.1 Description. Control manuals and associated CDMs are acquired to support Minuteman II and III missiles using
Boeing Space Division (BSD) Exhibit 64-29. Control manuals are numbered as USAF TOs and list applicable CDMs under
the contractor-assigned numbers. Speciﬁc operation and maintenance procedures are included in the CDMs.
7.11.3.2 Deﬁciency Reporting. Deﬁciencies in CDMs are reported by AFTO Form 22 against the control manual TO
number. Block 19 of the AFTO Form 22 will list the CDM number as well as the deﬁciency noted and recommended
corrective action.

mercial speciﬁcations and standards;2. Digital
ﬁles developed to a particular computer applica-
tion, such as Microsoft Word, Adobe Portable
Document Format (PDF), or Standard General-
ized Markup Language (SGML); 3. Publication
medium, such as paper versus digital. – v. To
arrange a document or publication IAW a spe-
ciﬁc format.
Formatting Output Speciﬁcation Instance
(FOSI): The FOSI speciﬁes the layout for each
page (page set), frame, or screen IAW the appli-
cable speciﬁcation and standard. The FOSI
reads an SGML-tagged ﬁle and produces an
output formatted for the speciﬁed presentation
method (printer, computer screen, etc.) A sepa-
rate FOSI is required for each document type
and each output medium. Only print FOSIs are
provided for ETIMS publishing using the Data-
Logics (DL) Composer.
Functional User Guide (FUG) : Detailed, proce-
dural documents on the Air Force Technical Or-
der Managers SharePoint Site which are to be
used in the management of ﬁelded TOs.
Hardness Critical Item (HCI) : A hardware item
at any indenture level that is mission critical
and which could degrade system survivability in
a nuclear or nonnuclear operational environment
if special procedures are not used in the design,
repair, manufacture, installation, or maintenance
of the item.
Hardness Critical Procedure (HCP) : Procedures
which could adversely affect the nuclear hard-
ness of a system or equipment item, or compro-
mise the safety and reliability of a nuclear
weapon system.
Integrated Master Plan (IMP) : An event-driven
document provided by a contractor as part of
the proposal, covering the critical events leading
to successful contract completion. Events will
be listed with entry and exit criteria (what must
happen before the process leading to the event
can start, and what must be completed before
the event is complete). For example, the event
’Deliver TOs’ could have an entry criterion of
’Complete In Process Reviews’, and an exit cri-
terion of ’Perform included procedures success-
fully as written’.
Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) : The IMS is
a CDRL deliverable, updated as required during
contract performance, used for managing and
tracking completion of program events.

fected by the product. The TO IPT should con-
sist of the TOMA, other affected AFMC manag-
ers, using command and other support agency
representatives, and contractor personnel in-
volved in the development and delivery of TOs.
Intellectual Property: Intellectual property is a
form of legal entitlement which allows its
holder to control the use of certain intangible
ideas and expressions. The term reﬂects the idea
that once established, such entitlements are gen-
erally treated by courts as if they were tangible
property. The most common forms of intellec-
tual property include patents, copyrights, trade-
marks, and trade secrets.
Interactive Electronic Technical Manual
(IETM): Technical Manual authored in a non-
linear fashion for the purpose of non-linear dis-
play (Type 2). IETM organization facilitates
easy user access to technical information while
the display device provides interactive proce-
dural guidance, navigational directions, and
supplemental information. An IETM facilitates
the interchange of maintenance manual informa-
tion with logistic support data supplemental to
maintenance, such as maintenance data collec-
tion, training documentation, supply interface
and data presentation control.
Item Unique Identiﬁcation (IUID): Labeling
which allows the automatic scanning of data
matrices on parts to improve the reliability and
usability of the Air Force’s future Information
Technology systems.
Lead Command: The Air Force assigns responsi-
bility for overall management of each system to
a lead command to ensure that all requirements
associated with every system receive compre-
hensive and equitable consideration. This lead
command provides a primary input into the pro-
cess of developing and maintaining a force
structure with a balance of complementary capa-
bilities, and it establishes a basis for rational
allocation of scarce resources among competing
requirements. When only one command uses a
weapon or equipment system, it is automatically
assigned Lead Command. See AFPD 10-9 for
aircraft/missile systems. and AFI 10-901 for
communications and information systems as-
signments
Major Command (MAJCOM): The activity at
the higher echelon responsible for management
and command control of systems or commodi-
ties. As used in this TO, MAJCOM includes
Field Operating Agencies (FOA) and Direct Re-
porting Units (DRU).

by AFMC.
Modiﬁcation: Any change, either retroﬁt or up-
date, to the conﬁguration of a CI.
Non-Conﬁgured Equipment : Equipment that is
representative of but does not reﬂect the current
conﬁguration of vehicles or systems in the Air
Force operational inventory (e.g., a prototype of
a new aircraft which will not be updated to the
ﬁnal approved conﬁguration, or a test-bed air-
craft used to ﬂight test and evaluate aeronautical
commodities and subsystems.) The latest issues
of the TO information compatible with the spe-
ciﬁc items of equipment are mandatory for use
with this equipment, but might not be listed as
active in the TO Catalog.
Non-ETIMS eTO: Electronically accessed, dis-
tributed and used digital TOs which are not
available in ETIMS for various reasons. These
eTOs will be numbered with a -WA-2 TO num-
ber suffix to differentiate them from ETIMS
eTOs. TODOs must independently establish ac-
cess to these eTOs IAW procedures provided by
the TOMA on TO Details page in ETIMS.
Non-Government Speciﬁcations (NGS) : Speciﬁ-
cations and standards developed and maintained
by commercial interests. NGS may be cited on
contracts when there are no government perfor-
mance speciﬁcations (MIL-PRF). Any NGS pro-
posed for development of TOs must be ap-
proved by AFLCMC/HIAM.
Nuclear Surety Procedure (NSP) : Procedures
which could adversely affect the nuclear hard-
ness of a system or equipment item, or compro-
mise the safety and reliability of a nuclear
weapon system.
Organic Maintenance: Maintenance performed
by the government under military control, using
government-owned or controlled facilities, tools,
test equipment, spares, repair parts, and military
or civilian personnel.

Operating Location: Generally, a physical loca-
tion where military systems or commodities are
assigned, operated, and maintained.
Optimization: To optimize a PDF ﬁle for web
viewing. With the pdf document open, perform
a Save As. When this is accomplished, Adobe
Acrobat Pro will restructure the document for a
page-at-a-time downloading from web servers.
Performance Speciﬁcation: Speciﬁcations limited
to deﬁning Form, Fit, Function and Interface
(F3I), without deﬁning or limiting processes,
procedures and methods used to achieve the end
result.
Portable Document Format (PDF) eTO : An
Adobe® PDF format TO ﬁle (updated using any
update format), merged and indexed as a revi-
sion, uploaded ETIMS (-WA-1) or other sources
(-WA-2) for distribution and viewing.
Preliminary Technical Orders (PTOs) : PTOs
are in-work drafts of TOs from initial assign-
ment of TO numbers until formalization. PTOs
are assigned a TO number and are identiﬁed by
a warning and the word PRELIMINARY on the
title page; PTOs will contain a Veriﬁcation Sta-
tus Page (VSP) (MIL-STD-38784).
Preparing Activity: The organization or activity
responsible for developing and maintaining
speciﬁcations, standards and DIDs in accordance
with DoDM 4120.24, Defense Standardization
Program Procedures. The preparing activity for
most AF TMSS is AFLCMC/HIAM. Two TMSS
are managed by AFSPC for space and missile
TOs. One speciﬁcation is managed by AFMET-
CAL for calibration TOs.
Pre-Publication Review : A ﬁnal review of a TO,
prior to reproduction, to ensure that all veriﬁca-
tion comments are included and the TO con-
forms to all speciﬁcation and contract require-
ments. The TOMA and designated
representatives from the using and supporting
commands, veriﬁcation team, and contractor
will comprise the review team. Members should
have technical background in the area covered
by the manual(s) under review. Familiarity with
the speciﬁc hardware being covered is desirable.
Prime ALC: The Air Logistics Complex where
the PM sustainment function is located.
Product Group: Aggregations of multiple prod-
ucts in all life cycle phases characterized by an
ongoing development requirement as well as a
much larger cumulative sustainment require-
ment. A Product Group consists of commodities
which can beneﬁt from common management
practices.
A-21

--------------------------------------------------

TO 00-5-3
Product Group Manager (PGM) : The program
manager for a Product Group. PGMs fulﬁll the
same responsibilities for their assigned products
as a System Program Director for the assigned
system. The PGM products are usually in direct
support of one or more SPDs.
Product Support Manager (PSM) : The major
duties of the PSM include supervising the entire
staff and professional procurement of all mate-
rial including hardware and software, etc.
Production Equipment: Equipment manufactured
or procured and deployed to the ﬁeld for opera-
tional use.
Program Manager (PM): As used in this instruc-
tion applies collectively to System Program Di-
rector, Product Group Manager, Single Manager,
Supply Chain Manager or acquisition program
manager. The PM has total life-cycle system
management for one or more programs and is
accountable to the Center Commander. The PM
is vested with full authority, responsibility and
resources to execute a program on behalf of the
Air Force.
Program Office: The integrated AFMC organiza-
tion responsible for cradle-to-grave management
of a military system.
Program Objective Memorandum : A document
submitted annually to forecast program’s ﬁnan-
cial requirements.
Programmed Depot (Equipment) Maintenance
(PDM/PDEM): PDM and PDEM requirements
as identiﬁed by the using command and system
engineers are compiled as work speciﬁcations in
a Statement of Work (SOW). Requirements may
include programmed upgrades, analytical condi-
tion inspections, and scheduled preventive main-
tenance. Aircraft MDS, equipment Type, Model,
Series (TMS), and system age determine PDM
requirements.
Proprietary Data: Proprietary data is technical
data submitted to the sponsor under a contract
and subject to protection by the contractor. Pro-
prietary information is conﬁdential information
that constitutes a trade secret and/or information
that is commercial or ﬁnancial and conﬁdential
and privileged. Something proprietary is some-
thing exclusively owned by someone, often with
connotations that it is exclusive and cannot be
used by other parties without negotiations. It
may speciﬁcally mean that something is covered
by one or more patents.
Prototype: A model or preliminary design of a
system or commodity suitable for evaluation of
design, performance, and production potential.
A-22

TO 00-5-3
Program Management Directive (PMD) : The
PMD is the official Air Force document used to
direct program responsibilities to the appropriate
MAJCOMs, Program Executive Officer (PEO),
Center Commander (CC), or appropriate organi-
zation for a speciﬁc system/subsystem develop-
ment, modiﬁcation, acquisition or directed pro-
curement effort.
Publication Date: The TO title page date estab-
lished by the TOMA; normally the date the re-
production copy is accepted by the Air Force, or
the date after which no further changes to be
contents are allowed (copy freeze date). This
date shall be adjusted due to publication delays,
issuance of Supplements or receipt of urgent
changes, and should be IAW MIL-STD-38784.
In all cases this date shall be later than all pre-
viously released increments (Basic, Revisions,
Changes, and Supplements).
Quality Assurance (QA): QA is the process by
which the contractor and government ensure
TOs and source data are technically accurate,
adequate, safe and readily understandable. The
contractor QA program will be speciﬁed in the
Integrated Master Plan. The primary government
QA process is veriﬁcation (Chapter 3). QA may
include process controls which include actual
task performance, simulation (when performance
could cause hazards to personnel or equipment)
or desktop analysis (for non-procedural data).
Rapid Action Changes (RAC) : Emergency or
Urgent TO Changes distributed electronically to
correct safety hazards or prevent mission degra-
dation and work stoppages. RACs are formatted
like routine TO Changes using the digital TO
ﬁle composition software to allow seamless
merging with the basic TO ﬁle. If the RAC is
not composed for seamless merging, regardless
of presentation format (page- or non-page-ori-
ented), the data must be directly accessible via
hyperlink to and from the affected location in
the TO.
Recommended Changes (RC): Recommendations
submitted on AFTO Form 22, 27, 158 or 252
for improvement of TOs or PTOs. RCs for ﬂight
manuals are submitted on AF Form 847 and
AFTO Form 252. RCs are divided into the three
categories of Emergency, Urgent and Routine
speciﬁed in Chapter 4.

Scientiﬁc and Technical Information (STINFO)
: Information relating to research, development,
engineering, testing, evaluation, production, op-
eration, use, and maintenance for military prod-
ucts, services, and equipment for military sys-
tems. This includes production, engineering, and
logistics information (AFI 61-201).
Single Point of Access: A single program and
web site which allows a user to access all active
digital TOs, no matter where stored, required to
perform mission requirements.
Standard Generalized Markup Language
(SGML -MIL-PRF-28001): SGML is a com-
puter-processable syntax for describing the logi-
cal and content structures of a document. Using
an SGML document type deﬁnition (DTD), a
speciﬁcation can rigorously and strictly deﬁne
the structure of a class of documents such as
job guides, ﬂight manuals, fault isolation proce-
dures, etc. SGML describes the format and
structure of the text in a document, not how the
document will appear as an output. A Formatted
Output Speciﬁcation Instance (FOSI) is required
to build an output presentation for a particular
SGML document. Perhaps the most attractive
feature is that documents coded with SGML can
be output in many different ways without con-
version or manual intervention with the copy.
Additionally, MIL- PRF-28001C, dated 2 May
1997 is inactive for new design and shall no
longer be used as a guidance reference for new
designs. (See NOTICE 1 attachment, dated 22
April 2010)
Static Filename : When uploading PDF eTO ﬁles
to the ETIMS repository, the naming convention
is the paper TO number with a .PDF extension
using all capital lettering (e.g., eTO 00-5-3-
WA-1 would be 00-5-3.PDF). This ﬁlename
remains static in support of external liking to
eTOs within and outside of their management
control.
Supply Chain Manager (SCM) : Designated in-
dividual(s) at an ALC responsible for managing
a line of National Stock Number (NSN)-coded
items. SCM functions include requirements de-
termination; cataloging, standardization and en-
gineering data management; stock control and
distribution; technical management functions;
and pricing for their assigned items. SCMs re-
port to ALC Commanders, but are responsible
for supplying, repairing, and managing materiel
to support PMs.
System: A ﬁnal combination of equipment items,
technical data, supply support, transportation,
policies and procedures which make up a self-
sufficient entity designed to perform a speciﬁc
mission.
A-24

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_168
TO 00-5-3
System Maturity: System maturity occurs during
the Production and Deployment phase when the
system design is stable and management empha-
sis changes from the acquisition to the sustain-
ment function.
System Program Director (SPD) : The individual
in a System Program Office who is ultimately
responsible and accountable for decisions and
resources in overall program execution. SPD is
the designated title for the program manager of
a program that reports to a Program Executive
Officer (PEO)/Product Center Commander dur-
ing the acquisition phase, or an ALC/CC during
system sustainment, and who presents the single
face to the user while overseeing the seamless
life-cycle processes.
Technical Content Manager (TCM) : The indi-
vidual, usually an Equipment Specialist (see
deﬁnition) or Engineer, responsible for main-
taining the accuracy, adequacy, modiﬁcation,
classiﬁcation, review and currency of the techni-
cal content of TOs and TCTOs supporting as-
signed systems, commodities or processes. In
sustainment, the TCM is identiﬁed in the
ETIMS record for his/her assigned TOs. TCMs
are not generally responsible for style and for-
mat or other non-technical aspects of manuals.
A-25

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_169
TO 00-5-3
Technical Data:1. (FAR deﬁnition) Technical data
is deﬁned in the Federal Acquisition Regulations
(FAR) as: Recorded information (regardless of
the form or method of recording) of a scientiﬁc
or technical nature (including software docu-
mentation) relating to supplies procured by an
agency. Technical data does not include com-
puter software or ﬁnancial, administrative, cost
or pricing, or management data or other infor-
mation incidental to contract administration.
This deﬁnition includes engineering data, source
data and TO data (for example, schematic dia-
grams, ﬂow diagrams, manufacturer handbooks,
manuscripts of O&M instructions, PTOs, com-
mercial TMs, Research and Development
(R&D) TMs, and other system or equipment
O&M procedures developed under AFMC or
other acquisition agency directions during the
system acquisition phase). Avoid use of this
term when referring to speciﬁc types of data. 2.
(DODD 2040.2,International Transfers of Tech-
nology, Goods, Services, and Munitions, deﬁni-
tion) - Classiﬁed or unclassiﬁed information of
any kind that can be used, or adapted for use, in
the design, production, manufacture, repair,
overhaul, processing, engineering, development,
operation, maintenance, or reconstruction of
goods or munitions; or any technology that ad-
vances the state of the art or establishes a new
art in an area of signiﬁcant military applicability
in the United States. The data may be tangible,
such as a model, prototype, blueprint, or an op-
erating manual, or may be intangible, such as a
technical service or oral or visual interactions.
Technical Manual Contract Requirement
(TMCR) Document, TM 86-01: The document
approved for use by the Department of the Air
Force to acquire TOs. It fully describes state-
ment of work criteria for contractor program
management, TO Quality Assurance, TO devel-
opment and update, TCTOs, delivery instruc-
tions, and generic tailoring of the approved stan-
dards and speciﬁcations.
Technical Order (TO): TMs developed to MIL-
SPECs or commercial manuals reviewed and
approved in accordance with MIL-PRF-32216,
managed in the Air Force TO System, and
meeting the criteria for TMs listed above. The
term Technical Order is equivalent to the DoD
term Technical Manual.
Technical Order Distribute and Print Gateway
(TODPG): TODPG provides TOMAs interface
to upload and manage TO content within
TODPS.
A-26

--------------------------------------------------
Page Page_170
TO 00-5-3
Technical Order Distribute and Print Services
(TODPS): TODPS is a Print on Demand con-
cept of operation being implemented enterprise
wide in the Air Force to replace legacy stock,
store and issue processes and reliance upon
ETIMS for process management. TODPS re-
quires the distribution and storage of digital TO
ﬁles in the DLA Data Management Services
central repository.
Technology: The technical information and know-
how that can be used to design, produce, manu-
facture, use, or reconstruct goods, including
technical data and computer software. The term
does not include the goods themselves.
TO Management Agent/TO Management
Agency (TOMA): The individual or organiza-
tion responsible for managing TOs related to
systems and commodities. Management encom-
passes all activities (except content manage-
ment) from acquisition through disposal of TOs
after the systems or commodities supported
leave the Air Force inventory. TOMAs are gen-
erally responsible for style, format and other
non-technical aspects of manuals.
TO Life Cycle Management Plan (TOLCMP) :
The government plan for management of all
facts of a major acquisition TO program. Less-
than-major programs may not require a
TOLCMP.
TO Life Cycle Veriﬁcation Plan (TOLCVP) :
The government plan for management of TO
Veriﬁcation throughout the life of the program.
TO Review Board (TORB)/Flight TORB
(FTORB) : The review boards responsible for
evaluation and approval of suggested changes to
TOs and ﬂight manuals. The boards may be
formal panels or a loosely structured group of
qualiﬁed individuals, but must be instituted and
empowered by PM letters of appointment.
TO System: The Air Force specialized publication
system for the acquisition, management, publi-
cation, ﬁling and use of technical manuals. The
TO System includes the hardware and software
for the standard TO management system, per-
sonnel and facilities, and all manuals developed
or acquired for organic operation, maintenance,
inspection, modiﬁcation, or management of cen-
trally-acquired and managed Air Force military
programs and end items. This includes paper
and digital copies of manuals developed IAW
Technical Manual Speciﬁcations & Standards,
non- embedded personal computer software
which automates the function directed by a TO,
contractor- developed manuals adopted for Air
Force use, and approved Commercial Off-The-
Shelf (COTS) manuals.

TO 00-5-3
Type 2 Technical Manual: See: Interactive Elec-
tronic Technical Manual (IETM)
Updates: Any changes to TOs or PTOs based on
approved RCs. Updates are distributed to users
in TO changes, revisions, and supplements IAW
TO 00-5-1.
User Friendly: Clear and concise instructions,
easily found and accessed, reliable with standard
processes for operating the eTool while navigat-
ing through the ﬁle and standard formats linking
related sections of the ﬁle to provide a high
quality and time saving experience during TO
use. This implies user friendly tech data, user
friendly eTO applications, and user friendly
equipment to view them on.
US Munitions List: This list designates defense
articles and defense services that are subject to
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
Veriﬁcation: Veriﬁcation is the process through
which Air Force personnel evaluate and prove
TOs, TO updates and TCTOs are accurate, ad-
equate, safe, and usable to support the using
command operational and maintenance concepts.
Veriﬁcation Status Page (VSP) : A VSP shall be
included in preliminary TOs to list all proce-
dures requiring veriﬁcation, and shall conform
to the requirements of MIL-STD-38784. On
PTOs that are 100% veriﬁed, the VSP may be
blank, but will indicate the current date of the
TO and any changes. The VSP will also be in-
cluded in formal TOs containing unveriﬁed pro-
cedures.
Veriﬁcation Team: Personnel assigned from vari-
ous participating commands to verify procedures
and to participate in the TORB/FTORB when
required. Team members should include person-
nel of the lowest skill level planned to perform
the procedures in the operational units.
Veriﬁcation Team Manager: The individual as-
signed the task of managing a veriﬁcation effort,
responsible for the veriﬁcation of assigned sys-
tem TOs as chartered by the TOMA. The VTM
shall be provided by the using command.
Work Stoppage: Work stoppage refers to the in-
ability to proceed with production on a repair or
modiﬁcation of an end item or commodity, or
where a given process stops due to nonconform-
ing material, inadequate technical data, or lack
of proper parts, materials, components, tooling
or facilities. Halted production of a component
or part that prevents the repair or continued
scheduled production ﬂow of an end item con-
stitutes a work stoppage.
